and i told it pretty much the same way i &apos;ve just shared it with you :
it &apos;s not negative ; it &apos;s positive . these are investments that pay for themselves .
invest sustainably . majora mentioned this .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , i need your help on this .
so this is a picture of rural haiti . haiti is now 98 percent deforested .
and conveniently , one of my students was from ghana ,
and he &apos;s found that worldwide , you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel . that &apos;s remarkable , but up until now , there weren &apos;t ways to do it without cutting down trees .
and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .
ashraf ghani : how to rebuild a broken state
and that is that if we want to have one world , this one world cannot be based on huge pockets of exclusion , and then inclusion for some .
the least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money .
the world in which i operate operates with designs regarding roads , or dams , or provision of electricity that have not been revisited in 60 years .
second is , when a country has been subjected to one of the most immense , brutal forms of exercise of power -- we had the red army for 10 continuous years , 110,000 strong ,
you know , when i went back in december of 2001 , i had absolutely no desire to work with the afghan government
a t-shirt does .
but they do .
i &apos;m really troubled by that . but anyway that &apos;s -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we inspire people who will be our great leaders later .
and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model airplanes .
there were only three or four flights in 2003 .
for a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn &apos;t even know what it was for .
you remember the space race in the &apos; 60s was for national prestige , because we lost the first two milestones .
and every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently by a factor of 10 to 15 . and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no taxpayer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa budgets for human space flight .
what interests me in this speech is cars . automobiles may be what you use , but cars are what we are , in many ways .
this sculpture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it &apos;s really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars .
you can understand that . it works in truisms .
that car stays at the middle of all our relationships .
right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven apartments , it was cheaper to rent elizabeth taylor &apos;s ex-house in malibu .
so we went to tiburon , after three months ,
how could they take bmw &apos;s money , how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
we cut a lot of strings that didn &apos;t need to be there , and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
we filter through some simple apparatuses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city .
and is getting very rapid and very cheap .
this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x 174 .
and here &apos;s that same dna automatically reassembled 24 hours later .
let me just close with ethical and policy studies .
every week , it &apos;ll arrive at your door .
and the calls that -- you know how they say , &quot; your call may be recorded for quality assurance ? &quot;
and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades .
it &apos;s not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices .
i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the &apos; 90s , and after the talk , i met one of the employees .
you try rhyming with garage !
in my very last example --
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
span than we do . that &apos;s pitiful , and it &apos;s preventable .
and what was so amazing to me , and what fits right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at ted , is that there , right in the middle of this rainforest , was some solar panels -- the first in that part of ecuador -- and that was mainly to bring water up by pump so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down .
and we use gsi -- geographic whatever it is , gsi -- to determine the range of the chimps .
the reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools .
we know that chimpanzees and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mirrors -- &quot; self &quot; as opposed to &quot; other . &quot;
of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the crippling poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot; &quot; how am i going to feed my family today ?
somebody said that yesterday . and as i was traveling around , i kept meeting young people who &apos;d lost hope .
it &apos;s going to depend whether they &apos;re inner-city or rural .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
and thirdly , the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last , talked about the indomitable human spirit .
thank you . it &apos;s really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teenager .
i was a passive observer of the medical world .
and while i was doing this , i was reading the cancer literature , trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field .
it &apos;s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle , but only .16 percent of actual metastases --
if those diseases where tissues are deteriorating -- for example alzheimer &apos;s , where the brain , the brain cells , die and we need to restore new brain cells , new functional brain cells -- what if we could , in the future , use cancer ? a tumor --
you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads --
and it was late in the evening . we &apos;d had a lot to drink .
it &apos;s taken several years to now look at it detached and say --
i knew craig and respected him .
fg : anyway , the siza thing . it &apos;s a richer experience .
that was the real surprise of bilbao .
fg : ask miriam !
to come in and do the bilbao effect .
rsw : well , i &apos;m going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it &apos;s been very long .
chris has asked me to do a short performance , and so i &apos;m going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that , and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form .
what i and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional mri brain scanner .
you feel intense elation when things are going well ; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly .
and , indeed , these people would say &quot; yes ! &quot; as if i had asked them to pass the salt .
the second of these three brain systems is romantic love : that elation , obsession of early love .
then , women &apos;s worst invention was the plow .
and i think that the television is like the global campfire .
&quot; well , men are more adulterous ! &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
they are seeping around the world .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know anything about personality . you know ?
so off they go and she &apos;s squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time .
and this grebe , i think , sort of , mistaked us for a prospect ,
and they said , calcium carbonate .
i think there &apos;s a lot more than 30 million -- well-adapted solutions .
in other words : structure .
and so silicon , which we make right now -- it &apos;s part of our carcinogenic problem in the manufacture of our chips --
color without pigments : this peacock is creating color with shape .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
janine benyus : oh really ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
but i was interested in another definition of technology .
every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard olivia &apos;s talk about the sexual habits , you &apos;ll realize that there isn &apos;t anything we can say that &apos;s true for all life ,
one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing sociability . and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life .
this is niles eldredge . he was the co-developer with stephen jay gould of the theory of punctuated equilibrium .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard .
and so a hammer , when we grab a hammer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grabbing .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you &apos;re gone .
we &apos;d like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of diet pepsi in order to have the perfect drink . &quot;
this was an enormous revelation .
and howard looked at their product line , and he said , what you have is a dead tomato society .
in six varieties : cheese , light , robusto , rich &amp; amp ; hearty , old world traditional -- extra-chunky garden . that &apos;s howard &apos;s doing . that is howard &apos;s gift to the american people .
used to be , there were two mustards : french &apos;s and gulden &apos;s .
for the longest time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
now in medical science , we don &apos;t want to know , necessarily , just how cancer works , we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer .
and --
during the hurricane , you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog , updating it frequently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .
i like music , and i like banjos , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get choked up , because this is my first pet , and she passed away two years ago .
and you see this post .
i would spend hours looking at the connections , saying , &quot; oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . &quot;
i had to go for a one-day trip .
&lt; speaker &gt; michael shermer &lt; / speaker &gt;
sir , do you want to empty your pockets , please , sir ?
or is it more likely that a reader of &quot; skeptic &quot; did this with photoshop ?
first of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
religious iconography .
anybody can do it , turns out .
so i will end with the new version .
and , once again , i got an extraordinary education ,
man : when we were at home , it was kony &apos;s &#91; rebel &#93; soldiers disturbing us .
and that may or may not be true -- i didn &apos;t think he was a liar , though .
in a sense the small , portable , dv cam was really what allowed it to come into being .
and what that &apos;s done is it &apos;s created , like i said , a vibrant community that &apos;s very inclusive , with people continually working to connect musical ideas , innovate them and keep things constantly up to date .
and i think if you could do this , it would be called -- i &apos;m just going to refer to it as a knowledge ecosystem .
because just providing free content to people has actually been likened by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural imperialism --
and i think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publishing .
and i &apos;ll just give you my personal story .
the creative commons licenses .
so this is a little bit of a problem . so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control
that way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you &apos;re really just chattin &apos; with your pals .
you don &apos;t write a psalm .
i &apos;ll begin with this concept of what i call dna .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i &apos;d failed .
this is a scan through the human forearm . it &apos;s then blown up through rapid prototyping to reveal its cellular structure . i have these in my office .
this is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
and i can hear greg lynn laughing his socks off as i say that .
so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
you take them off your wall , you plug them in . off you go .
and this is a carbon-fiber handrail which is only supported in two places .
the first sculptural model i made for that thing in tokyo .

the way the tv-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads , interrupt some people , that gets you distribution .
because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
every week , the number one best-selling dvd in america changes .
that &apos;s what mass marketing is .
these guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
oh , you like my ring ? it &apos;s my grandmother .
now , at countless meetings at , you know , the portland city council , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get frank gehry ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : &quot; freakonomics &quot; author steven levitt presents new data on the finances of drug dealing . contrary to popular myth , he says , being a street-corner crack dealer isn &apos;t lucrative : it pays below minimum wage . and your boss can kill you .
you couldn &apos;t sell cocaine ;
not really me -- i &apos;m really a bit player in all this .
he was held hostage overnight in the stairwell .
but they had seen movies like &quot; wall street , &quot; and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world .
it was below the minimum wage . and this is well-documented .
so for comparison &apos;s purposes , let &apos;s think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely risky .
but the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
it &apos;s exactly this concept .
thank you very much .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; --
and the free cure is adult seatbelts , and the expensive cure -- the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats .
and what you find is that the car seats and the lap-and-shoulder belts , when it comes to saving lives , fatalities look exactly identical .
and so , we went to buffalo , new york , and here is the precursor to it .
so this car seat was actually an above-average car seat from consumer reports , and did quite well .
it &apos;s just actually -- you see , this is folding up -- it &apos;s behind the seat .
is there any data to show that child seats are actually less effective , or just as effective as seatbelts for serious injury ? because that would prove your case . )
let me start some place . i &apos;m interested -- i kind of do the same thing , but i don &apos;t move my body . and instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space ,
and that directly connects to ideas of city-making .
this is the caltrans building in los angeles .
and then -- well , he was probably looking at this -- this is nazca ; this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures .
and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion , broken up by a series of courts , and it &apos;s five acres of uninterrupted , horizontal space for their administrative offices .
well , then we get to this image .
while creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable , or even pointless , creativity is always meaningful .
the first person was wearing a black tie , a tuxedo . it was me .
but i was still , you know -- this is a kitty cloud .
this is &quot; 6,500 yards , &quot; after corot . &quot; 9,000 yards , &quot; after gerhard richter .
this is richard serra .
in theater , you have the character and the actor in the same place , trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience .
and this happens every two weeks .
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
and he still is holding this line .
one of the things i did just before 9 / 11 -- august of 2001 -- i took my son , dax , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
and the way we &apos;ve done this -- we teach digital storytelling to these kids .
and this kid lived in the village -- he wasn &apos;t there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .
and my mother was irish catholic , and -- but she didn &apos;t take religion too seriously .
you can read it in about two hours .
the people from london came up .
we rushed over to the chemistry department and said , &quot; could pauling be right ? &quot; and alex hust said , &quot; no . &quot; so we were happy .
it &apos;s the order of the four bases .
and so i didn &apos;t really get happy until 1960 , because then we found out , basically , you know , that there are three forms of rna .
but wigler , besides looking at cancer cells , looked at normal cells , and made a really sort of surprising observation .
now , we don &apos;t have really any evidence of it , but i think , to give you a hypothesis , the best guess is that if you &apos;re left-handed , you &apos;re prone to schizophrenia .
and at certain points we were walking around , he grabbed my hand for support , which is something most kenyans would never consider doing .
&quot; armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation : they paid 1,500 shillings in rent , about 20 bucks a month , a relatively high price for a kenyan shantytown , and they could not afford to be late with the money .
&apos;once you have stayed here , &apos; he said , &apos; you can stay for the rest of your life . &apos; &quot; so , he has hope , and this is where these communities start .
this is the main drag of rocinha , the estrada da gavea , and there &apos;s a bus route that runs through it , lots of people out on the street .
and that little hut right there has a pump in it , and that &apos;s what people do :
and there were three old ladies who lived in -- that &apos;s her self-built house behind her -- and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years ,
but if you know anything about the history of britannica since 1962 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , stodgy type of encyclopedia .
how popular we &apos;ve gotten to be -- we &apos;re a top-50 website and we &apos;re more popular than the new york times .
so the big question when you &apos;ve got this really chaotic organization is , why isn &apos;t it all rubbish ? why is the website as good as it is ?
and it wasn &apos;t because they were contentious ; it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly .
so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as it &apos;s created .
when somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anonymous ip number , made an edit to my page . that sounds suspicious . who is this person ? somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see , ok , well , these words have changed , things like this .
and it also matters who the people are who are voting .
it just isn &apos;t appropriate .
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 38 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and , i noticed that most inventions fail , not because the r &amp; amp ; d department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business plans , they will actually succeed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the timing is wrong -- not all the enabling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
it took us half a century to adopt the telephone , the first virtual-reality technology .
and that &apos;s a very profound explosion of exponential growth .
you would think it would be a very erratic process , and you have a very smooth outcome of this chaotic process .
that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago .
with super-computing simulations , where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots .
but then the question is , ok , we can get this data now , but can we understand it ?
it &apos;ll be millions of times more powerful than it is today .
they both empower our promise and our peril .
that &apos;s very good news , because i thought that was what the answer would be .
and therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . &quot;
this is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .
but irrespective of that age , i &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
they &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
this list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
so of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
ag : because i am an old man . i am actually 158 .
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
i went down to a remote lagoon in australia , hoping to see the earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue .
stromatolites were the first to exhale oxygen .
life turned hard so it could venture inland .
when the skies cleared , a new world was born .
and where water is liquid , it becomes a womb
and at some point i &apos;ll even pass around what the $ 100 laptop might be like .
a little bit more recently , i got involved personally .
we &apos;re interested in perfect color uniformity .
that can drop to eight ; it can drop to seven
is it all worked out ? no .
so i can &apos;t quite name them .
it looks like a post-office truck .
that &apos;s a pretty soft landing . thank you .
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it . and we can see places where stars are forming , like the eagle nebula . we see stars dying .
stars are fueled by how the nuclei in those atoms react together .
we depend on stars to make the atoms we &apos;re made of .
indeed , catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure -- error rather than terror .
i wrote my book , &quot; our final century , &quot; as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there &apos;s one respect , i think , in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective ,
the continental landmasses drifted around .
&lt; speaker &gt; paul bennett &lt; / speaker &gt;
and they were sort , you know , blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious .
i &apos;m going to read this because i want to get these names right .
we use this phrase &quot; workarounds &quot; a lot , sort of , looking around us . i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i &apos;ve been here .
i talk about unthinking situations all the time .
again , that &apos;s one of the themes that i think has come through loud and clear in this conference
ted talk subtitles and transcript : violinist sirena huang gives a technically brilliant and emotionally nuanced performance . in a charming interlude , the 11-year-old praises the timeless design of her instrument .
the violin is very beautiful .
thank you .
how do i compose ?
anyone to come up here and choose five --
david deutsch : chemical scum that dream of distant quasars
can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ?
that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time .
probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back .
and the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem , merely to postpone it by a little . so it &apos;s already too late to avoid it , and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger .
&lt; speaker &gt; joshua prince-ramus &lt; / speaker &gt;
they can be pushed off-center a little bit , but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you originally had hoped .
our first operation was to re-digest it back to them , show it to them and say , &quot; you know what ? we haven &apos;t touched it , but only one-third of your own program is dedicated to media and books .
it just so happens to be on the 6th through 10th floors of the building , but that is not necessarily an expensive approach .
and now up .
we invest the money in the operation of the building .
they inverted the whole idea of development .
just lift the entire block , flip some of the elements over , reposition them so they have appropriate views and relationships to downtown , and make circulation connections and reroute the road .

well , there was a question , of course , that was on my mind for a while : you know , can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don &apos;t like to be doing ?
this is from the front .
and it was co-sponsored by the pentagon -- it &apos;s independent , it &apos;s peer-reviewed and all of the backup calculations are transparently posted for your perusal .
the more we keep on using the oil , particularly the imported oil , the more we face a very obvious array of problems .
and can , indeed , be done administratively or at a state level .
this is not very gratifying after more than a century of devoted engineering effort .

unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities .
these things make me different from you .
antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day
we also built new york city &apos;s first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices .
and we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count .
that led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas .
so that means , you know , somebody who &apos;s based in mississippi knows more about mississippi than i do . so what happened is , we used meetup and all these other internet tools , and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up , thousands of architects in 104 countries .
within three days , we realized the problem was not housing ; it was the growing pandemic of hiv / aids .
so this is about getting an economic engine , and then at night , it turns into a movie theater .
so when you come to tedglobal , you can check it out .
we &apos;ve had over 1,500 volunteers rebuilding , rehabbing homes .

this is my mother and aunt teaching donna how to ride a bike .
i got drawn into this community and i began to take pictures there .
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ?
it was absolutely revolting .
in the united states , i was blown away by the motivations , the positive motivations of the american people when they &apos;d see this film .
&#91; may god forgive you . &#93;
&#91; george : but there is a teacher that is in charge ? &#93;
and that &apos;s an amazing thing .
there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ; to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .
walk around for four months with three wishes , and all the ideas will start to percolate up .
and that became one of the most surreal landscapes i &apos;ve ever seen . totally transformed by man .
and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defines kind of what i feel , too --
and i thought , &quot; my god , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir , and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
you &apos;re seeing the tuxedos , the bouquets .
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years , or maybe even thousands of years ,
it &apos;s breathtaking , in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is , again , one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills .
while setting up this shot , people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch .
i want to dedicate my wishes to my two girls .
they could be posted through the web ;
and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best artwork for &quot; in my world . &quot; and what would happen -- it &apos;s a scalable thing . and if we can get people to put in things --
i &apos;m too busy . so i need somebody who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that ,
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called &quot; medicine ball caravan . &quot;
you should see it from the perspective of a mother , watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly .

and now , their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent , because other nations have started to report .
you can , it turns out , be in two places at once .
another very tall , grizzled rock star , my friend sir bob geldof , issued a challenge to &quot; feed the world . &quot;
that &apos;s not a cause . that &apos;s an emergency .
not here , not in america , not in europe .
now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone , maybe we should listen .
well , much more than we think .
most of you did , the digital world .
we believe this is one .
and we &apos;d like you to give us that energy .
i wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million american activists for africa .
this has to be described as an adventure , not a burden .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
so my grandfather told me when i was a little girl , &quot; if you say a word often enough , it becomes you . &quot;
well , some of you are laughing . everybody laughs when i say that , but not on this train . silence .
so the human touch , you see , it &apos;s disappearing .
and this is an inmate named paulette jenkins .
her face was bruised . she had a black eye .
everybody knows that the los angeles riots happened because four cops beat up a black man named rodney king .
i was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict , and all the day they were having a party , they celebrated , all of south central , all the churches . and they say , &apos; well , finally justice has been done in this society . &apos;
and i &apos;ve been going to the rodeos with him , and we &apos;ve bonded .
i mean , like , pat o &apos;mealey always said when i was a boy , he say , &apos; you know , you got more try than any kid i ever seen . &apos;
&lt; speaker &gt; steven johnson &lt; / speaker &gt;
because if we get it out of the streets , it &apos;ll smell much better , and -- oh right , we drink from the river .
just an extraordinary , terrifying scene .
and that was the last time that london has seen a cholera outbreak since .
there &apos;s a billion people without clean drinking water .
to climate change that would be like kyoto .
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
that is what economists do .
so the guy in bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106 .
this third best one was free trade .
we should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
the other objections , i think , that are important to say , is that i &apos;m somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice .
and that gives me great hope , really , in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities ,
because traditional economic theory would say , well , the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation that had a big r &amp; amp ; d lab where they were thinking up new projects , and it came out of there . it didn &apos;t come from there .
build creative clusters in cities ; create more r &amp; amp ; d parks , so on and so forth .
big corporations have an in-built tendency to reinforce past success .
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
because the professionals , over here in these closed organizations -- they might be academics ; they might be programmers ; they might be doctors ; they might be journalists -- my former profession -- say , &quot; no , no -- you can &apos;t trust these people over here . &quot; when i started in journalism -- financial times , 20 years ago -- it was very , very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper .
so it &apos;s not going to be a contest between two camps , but , in between them , you &apos;ll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occupy .
or you can get on a plane , fly to shanghai , queue up outside shanda &apos;s offices -- cost probably 600 , 700 dollars -- and reclaim your character , get your history back .
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other vaginas .
&quot; hurry , nurse , bring the vagina ! &quot;
there are three qualities i want to talk about .
and in one year , it went to 50 colleges , and then it expanded .
and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular panel ,
and she applied , hoping that she would become a finalist and she could bring her sister .
and she walked through the rift valley , and she had vagina and vagina replacement parts , where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like , and what a mutilated vagina looks like . and in the course of her travel -- she walked literally for eight years through the rift valley , through dust , through sleeping on the ground , because the maasai are nomads ,
and in the maasai community , goats and cows are the most valued possession .
this thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time .
there &apos;s no manual . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interacted with a computer before .
as you can see , i can use the same two-fingered gestures to go down and go in really seamlessly . there &apos;s no interface , again .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation .
what we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original --
this was the love of his life , sarah .
they &apos;re just a form of life ,
and i think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
i &apos;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot; epiphany , &quot; which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent .
people who had to move to think . &quot; who had to move to think . they did ballet , they did tap , jazz ; they did modern ; they did contemporary .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 67 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
we &apos;re not top on people &apos;s lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on .
so you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment .
and you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that .
you &apos;re a little bit excited with the first head -- you get rather more excited with the next tail .
and i will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in oxford ,
what &apos;s the chance that they do ?
one explanation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s overwhelmingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is unlikely .
unfortunately here -- and , really , regrettably -- first of all , in a situation like this you &apos;d have to verify it empirically .
now , we probably think a priori that &apos;s unlikely .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re bad at doing .
&lt; / doc &gt;
a lot of you have heard the term &quot; memes . &quot; the evolution of technology , i pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand axe .
a lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooperation .
but i assume that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many expressions of , you know , bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups , because the people who are flying trans-atlantic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , capitalism has been a constructive force ,
i think we &apos;re going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .
to really understand it , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; oh , i get it .
which at the time , was a pretty high-level social organization .
and i &apos;m going to tell you what really leads to success and makes tedsters tick .
a lot of kids want to be millionaires .
and i &apos;m often asked , &quot; why do you think so many people have read this ?
as a pastor , i do see a lot of kooks .
and then when i wrote this book , and all of a sudden , it just took off , and i started saying , now , what &apos;s the purpose of this ?
and so , you need to understand what your worldview is .
and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals , it makes a difference .
it doesn &apos;t come from salary .
your value is not based on your valuables . it &apos;s based on a whole different set of things .
number one , god never does a miracle to show off .
what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : chris anderson , then the editor of wired , explores the four key stages of any viable technology : setting the right price , gaining market share , displacing an established technology and , finally , becoming ubiquitous .
and at each one of these stages , can be seen as a collision -- a collision with something else -- for example , a critical price-line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . it &apos;s an inflection point .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implication of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
and the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that .
they already have nearly four million registered users -- that &apos;s critical mass .
thank you .
i mean , these are sort of the extreme examples , and they &apos;re amusing and good to laugh at .
the first was , how did we get so fast ?
and , in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration , lie what a lot of people now refer to as the &quot; international slow movement . &quot;
i mean , the pointer sisters said it most eloquently , didn &apos;t they ,
so wherever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same :
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life .
i find that 10 minutes into a story , you know , my son will suddenly say , &quot; you know , something happened in the playground today that really bothered me . &quot;
so , you know , sustainability , small planet .
a third of the people on this planet are kids .
we &apos;re already an urban planet ; that &apos;s especially true in the developed world .
if you &apos;re somebody who drives , you know , one day a week , do you really need your own car ?
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly .
and one of the things we &apos;re really , really interested in at worldchanging is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself , and re-categorizing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room .
another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call &quot; serious play . &quot;
here &apos;s a fog-catcher , which , if you live in a moist , jungle-like area , will distill water from the air that &apos;s clean and drinkable .
i also love it because it seems to me that the example , the tools we use to change the world , ought to be beautiful in themselves .
think about that number : 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries .
in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time .
trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank .
that means that they have no sports ; they have no latest news ; circulation goes down .
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
so it sounds like a great story .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough investors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring .
&lt; speaker &gt; susan savage-rumbaugh &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; i think we &apos;ve attributed it to our biology , but i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
ss : he talks to other bonobos at the lab , long-distance , farther than we can hear .
kanzi &apos;s rock is from gona , ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
video : this lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
&lt; / doc &gt;
so , the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end , or it can smash with the heel .
so that was really cool and very unexpected .
so , we &apos;ve had very solid evidence showing that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends , and does , in fact , function as a spring .
and again , that brings us back to the importance of that spring in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system .
you can see it coming in , and an incredible flash of light , and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail .
and also the miller institute for basic research in science , which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time , and for that i &apos;m very grateful . thank you very much .
we can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents . what do you see here ?
that when you saw from one little angle was like
so , if you measured them , they would be . and as i say , those two figures are identical in size and shape .
and so you can see , the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
and chris is a fisherman farmer . both are generalists .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s lacking in a poor country .
even in bangladesh , there are some empty places .
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot;
it turns out that what this stuff is -- and richard dawkins has written about this -- is , this is really a river out of eden .
so , this little thingamajig has a genome that &apos;s 200 times the size of yours .
and the reason why they &apos;re ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sulfuric acid in batteries , and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core .
it takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time .
why would cliff be doing that ? he doesn &apos;t have a restaurant .
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
well , it turns out that there &apos;s about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the united states to the united states ; about 4.6 trillion is going over to those european countries ; about 5.5 &apos;s going to japan ; there &apos;s almost no communication between japan , and nobody else is literate in this stuff .
that &apos;s why nations rise and fall .
and it &apos;s all getting very fragmented . and this has not stopped .
♫ oh please , oh please , oh please me right ♫ ♫ i want what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have what i don &apos;t have , what i want ♫ ♫ what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have but i don &apos;t have -- you know that ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go ♫ ♫ nobody knows how to hold me , no ♫
that &apos;s an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
it also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it attaches . they take the load off , and it becomes , again , compliant .
as a little boy , and through my teenage years , i became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life .
and moreover , responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean .
and that may be just the beginning !
i found my magical ants , but only after a tough climb into the mountains where the last of the native cuban forests hung on , and were then -- and still are -- being cut back .
we urgently need to change this .
it will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity .
it puts a human face on issues which from afar can appear abstract or ideological or monumental in their global impact .
an anti-sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded as commander zero attacked a town in southern nicaragua .
farmers were driven off their land , and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen .
the imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home .
these heroin addicts in detox in pakistan reminded me of figures in a play by beckett : isolated , waiting in the dark , but drawn to the light .
a few minutes later when i looked again and saw the second tower burning , i knew we were at war .
i tried to imagine myself in their place , and i was totally humbled by their courage and determination in the face of such catastrophic loss .
the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .
none in india . there are now at least a half a million active .
that children &apos;s medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year .
so what we have been trying to do , working first in rwanda and then in malawi and other places -- but i want to talk about rwanda tonight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with aids , tb , malaria , other infectious diseases , maternal and child health , and a whole range of health issues poor people are grappling with in the developing world ,
and the results were so good that the rwandan government has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country , and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it .
about 40 percent of all the people who need tb treatment are now getting it --
i am grateful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
how could it not have sunk in when they &apos;d been telling me ?
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you &apos;re capable of committing any and all sins against god and man . &quot; and bill said , &quot; so ? &quot; and i said , &quot; so , you &apos;re six . you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won &apos;t notice it . &quot; and he said , &quot; so ? &quot;
now , i just live off a main thoroughfare in los angeles , and my block is -- well , it &apos;s a natural beginning for people who are peddling things door to door .
then they told me how lehi and his descendants reproduced and reproduced , and over the course of 600 years , there were two great races of them , the nephites and the lamanites , and the nephites were totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the lamanites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone .
well , then they didn &apos;t look so fresh-faced and cute to me any more , but they had more to say .
&lt; / doc &gt;
the only assistance i need from you , which i know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ;
but they said , &quot; no , but don &apos;t show anyone . &quot; but they slipped up .
and i know what you &apos;re saying , &quot; holy crap ! how is his presentation so smooth ? &quot;
but you come back as a duck .
in fact , it &apos;s tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse . so , we go ahead , and we start scribbling .
this is me . my name is ben saunders .
i was 23 years old . no one my age had attempted anything like this , and pretty quickly , almost everything that could have gone wrong did go wrong .
and i had a ski pole with a union jack , you know , flying in the wind .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
nasa described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began .
it wasn &apos;t all high-tech . this is navigating in what &apos;s called a whiteout .
i skied on for a week past the pole .
he threw his cigarette out as he got on the front , and i climbed in the back .
on a wider scale , i hope that this journey was a chance to inspire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet .
ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my story .
on the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ;
but all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication . computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits .
ken olsen famously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor .
they were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use , but they brought computing down to work groups ,
the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
until one day in ninth grade , when i was standing with a number of the football players .
and the good news was that the institution , the banking institution , lasted .
they typically pay for critical goods and services like water , like healthcare , like housing , and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in karachi and nairobi .
the question , though , is not &quot; why can &apos;t we ? &quot; the question is how can we help africans do this for themselves ?
she brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets , five dollars apiece , despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one , and we learned a lot about how you sell things .
and i started in our medical university , karolinska institute , an undergraduate course called global health .
&quot; well , that &apos;s long life and small family , and third world is short life and large family . &quot;
they move up into that corner .
and this is latin america . it has everything on this earth , from the poorest to the richest in latin america .
i can split south asia here . india &apos;s the big bubble in the middle .
you have to train health staff . you have to educate the population .
and this won &apos;t work . so what is needed ? we have the databases .
this is the income distribution of china , 1970 . this is the income distribution of the united states , 1970 .
it &apos;s wonderful to be back .
because what i &apos;ve been doing for the last four years -- really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion -- and in the last four years , i &apos;ve been working just about non-stop on this topic .
misinformed consent is not worth it .
that &apos;s the steward .
evolution is cleverer than you are .
98 percent .
true story .
is it a good goal ? in itself , i &apos;m sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
with me , everybody -- every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
and then i find this : &quot; all the evidence available in the biological sciences supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole with life and mankind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning and explanation in this central fact . &quot;
whose truth are we going to listen to ?
here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions .
you got in it and you did it so often that it became real .
i &apos;m also looking to see what is shaping the person &apos;s ability to contribute , to do something beyond themselves . maybe the real question is ,
when you ask people , have you failed to achieve something significant in your life ?
they tell us we don &apos;t have the resources , but ultimately ,
you &apos;ve got it in your brain ; you &apos;ve got it in your lungs .
everyone needs certainty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable . now , how do you get it ?
here &apos;s what we really need : connection and love , fourth need . we all want it ;
and somebody came to the door and delivered food .
and they &apos;re a fireman , and somebody else says , &quot; i &apos;m going to kill people to do it . &quot;
for a program i was conducting , for a week .
and i said , &quot; what are we going to focus on ?
when you have 21 minutes to speak , two million years seems like a really long time .
interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
as a challenge to myself , since i say this once in a while in lectures , i took a copy of the new york times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness . here are three guys synthesizing happiness .
he wouldn &apos;t lend him the money , and of course , six months later ray kroc had exactly the same idea .
you bring in , say , six objects , and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked .
i &apos;ll take number three . &quot;
this capacity to synthesize happiness , but some of us do this trick better than others .
so we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memories of .
wrong-o . bad simulators . because here &apos;s what &apos;s really happening .
but when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures , we are at risk .
the biologist lewis wolpert believes that the queerness of modern physics is just an extreme example . science , as opposed to technology , does violence to common sense .
as frightening as the prospect was , he was going into the next office .
steve grand points out that you and i are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
j.b.s. haldane himself had something to say about animals whose world is dominated by smell .
if life has arisen only once on any -- life could originate once per planet , could be extremely common or it could originate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe , in which case it would have to be here . and somewhere up there would be the chance that a frog would turn into a prince , and similar magical things like that .
to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the pleistocene of africa ?
and i went to the it guys here
when i go to a philosopher &apos;s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
if you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
people &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
here &apos;s a completely different effect . this is a painting by bellotto .
you think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there .
it &apos;s a necker cube .
and this will just continue , and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change .
how many engines on the wing of that boeing ?
that &apos;s my only real aim in life .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc . however , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it &apos;s so unbelievably shallow .
that of a difference . then gradually ... and gradually ...
if there were no resonators on here , we would have ... so he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn &apos;t experience either .
or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blindness is about .
see , you &apos;re awake .
like that . and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .
henry james would be proud .
so if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility , reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put wheels on our luggage .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of stones . &quot;
when i went to yale , we had the first energy crisis ,
we &apos;re adding the jeffersonian agenda , and i come from charlottesville , where i &apos;ve had the privilege of living in a house designed by thomas jefferson .
the biological one i &apos;m sure you understand , but also the technical one , where we take materials and put them into closed cycles .
that makes more energy than it needs to operate and purifies its own water . here &apos;s a building for the gap , where the ancient grasses of san bruno , california , are on the roof .
this is their plan .
we &apos;ve lifted the earth up onto the roofs .
i don &apos;t have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet -- like getrich.com .
and you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bowl to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in annual revenue .
and this was huge . the first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan .
so this was -- remember , they didn &apos;t wire the houses for electricity .
this is what it looks like under my desk .
1998 : &quot; amazon.toast. &quot; in 1999 : &quot; amazon.bomb. &quot; my mom hates this picture .
i &apos;ll get the nitwit on the network news saying , &quot; we &apos;ll be back in a moment with more on the crisis . &quot;
it &apos;s a very strange world inside a nanotube .

exploring the feminine , nurturing side of divinity .
and if this is true , it must also be that god knows the joy and exaltation of the human spirit , as well .
so the first big question is about control .
such a god would be morally inferior to the highest ideals of humanity .
the people knew their god by his mighty acts .
to have faith in this god would be more like trusting an essential benevolence in the universe , and less like believing a system of doctrinal statements .
thank you .
it &apos;s just creationism under another name ,
the standard creationist argument -- there is only one ; they &apos;re all reduced to this one -- takes off from a statistical improbability .
&quot; everybody gets absolutely frantic about it , because you &apos;re not allowed to say these things . yet when you look at it rationally , there &apos;s no reason why those ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to debate as any other , except that we &apos;ve agreed somehow between us that they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; and that &apos;s the end of the quote from douglas .
in practice , what is an atheist ?
and i know that there are -- if i could put a little plug here -- there are people in this audience easily capable of financing a massive research survey to settle the question , and i put the suggestion up , for what it &apos;s worth .
when a critical mass has been obtained , there &apos;s an abrupt acceleration in recruitment .
you would strictly have to be agnostic about whether there is a teapot in orbit about mars , but that doesn &apos;t mean you treat the likelihood of its existence as on all fours with its non-existence .
but if we did achieve it with that dread word &quot; atheist &quot; itself , the political impact would be even greater .
♫ c &apos;est lui pour moi . moi pour lui ♫ ♫ dans la vie , ♫ ♫ il me l &apos;a dit , l &apos;a jure &#91; pour &#93; la vie . ♫ ♫ et des que je l &apos;apercois ♫ ♫ alors je sens en moi ♫ ♫ mon coeur qui bat ♫
what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
the idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
sometimes when people say , &quot; do memes exist ? &quot;
i &apos;m just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective , which i recommend .
one of the things that we are doing is we &apos;re the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes -- the memes that they are prepared to die for .
♫ i am blue ♫ ♫ blue is a river ♫ ♫ blue remembered ♫ ♫ blue water ♫ ♫ running clear ♫ ♫ blue like a planet ♫ ♫ to a spaceman ♫ ♫ blue river ♫ ♫ of my tears ♫ ♫ so i came here ♫ ♫ to the city ♫ ♫ where the dream burns ♫ ♫ like a furnace ♫ ♫ and i dazzled ♫
and they &apos;re labeled by color right now , by language .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
in fact , many of the organizations that are here -- the acumen fund , i think approtec we have running , i &apos;m not sure if that one &apos;s up yet --
and these are all of his friends .
and so he started clustering it by category ,
raise your hands .
and they don &apos;t always do their laundry as much as they should .
and the nice thing about this , we have a self-serve program ,
so , &quot; related searches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our adsense ads , called &quot; related searches . &quot;
we accept payment for advertising , and we mark it as such .

this is a body of knowledge , method , skill and principle that we threw in the garbage after world war ii and decided we don &apos;t need that anymore ; we &apos;re not going to use it .
it has something that is terribly important -- it has what &apos;s called an active and permeable membrane around the edge .
and they shouted at me and said , &quot; it was raining that day when you took that picture ! &quot;
so the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty .
and that &apos;s the great non-articulated agony of suburbia and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule .
chris asked me not to go on too long about this , and i won &apos;t ,
and we &apos;re going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development .
&lt; / doc &gt;
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clothing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on .
the next video is not done by us .
so this building actually celebrates the water as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be filtered for the final time .
( narrator : and this central box connects the whole system together .
and in my own practice , from product to approtec , it &apos;s really exciting that we &apos;re taking a more human-centered approach to design , that we &apos;re including behaviors and personalities in the things we do ,
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
and i &apos;ll try to do all that in 20 minutes . i have two affiliations .
this is a quote from that article . he said , &quot; what is conspicuously lacking , &quot; he &apos;s a very proper british gentleman so , &quot; what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas in which to interpret these different approaches . &quot;
so why should we have a good brain theory ?
there were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year , and every one of them is doing research in brains .
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
and if you &apos;re a rat and you go through a maze , and then you learn the maze ,
you &apos;re constantly making predictions about your environment .
anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn &apos;t tell you exactly how it &apos;s working in the brain and how the wiring works in the brain , it is not a theory .
so you &apos;re not going to see c-3po .
and it &apos;s a lively and a lovely place , but we &apos;re rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our overfishing , our irresponsible fishing , our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland , but also , most recently , with climate change ,
the mola &apos;s no exception .
and in the mediterranean , in the swordfish net fisheries , they make up up to 90 percent .
not this time of year -- it &apos;s more around october .
so the hardest part of tagging , now , is after you put that tag on , you have to wait , months .
this is part of a much larger program called the census of marine life , where they &apos;re going to be tagging all over the world and the mola &apos;s going to enter into that .
and sometimes i &apos;m puzzled , and i ask myself why .
the results are showing : independent monitoring by the world bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving .
not the international monetary fund . not the world bank , where i worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president .
so what did we try to do ? we introduced a fiscal rule that de-linked our budget from the oil price .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
but imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be employed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
so i invite you to explore the opportunities .
we went to brazil . we went to china and to india , to bentonville , arkansas , to washington , d.c. and to sacramento .
so , let me tell you this : when wal-mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions , that &apos;s going to be a very big deal . but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not enough .
i &apos;ve got a behind-the-scenes story for you about that green tech network i described .
compare that to the u.s. : five percent are flex-fuel .
so , if all goes well , they &apos;re going to have designer bugs in warm vats that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels .
not enough to keep the ice in greenland from crashing into the ocean .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or ebay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
but the young people all came .
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .
and we feel ourselves differently . it &apos;s totally strange .
you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is , how it can be changed .
&lt; speaker &gt; anand agarawala &lt; / speaker &gt;
also some of the stuff we can do is , for these individual icons we thought -- i mean , how can we play with the idea of an icon , and push that further ?
i can toss these things around . they &apos;re so much more tangible and touchable --
we need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer .
the poor pc guy . they &apos;re duct taping his head . they &apos;re just wrapping it on him .
an ortho-view , a nadir-view . how do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery while maintaining the fluidity of the model ?
because of that , we still have the old mindset of developing in industrialized countries , which is wrong .
will it be possible that this will happen ?
and the bubbles keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and we go back to 1920 , and i want to look at japan .
sweden was like ghana .
and in the discussion i attended with global leaders , you know , many say now the problem is that the emerging economies ,
and here it &apos;s a much nicer bedroom , you can see .
the women told us one thing . &quot; get us technology .
i only know two types of wine -- red and white .
environment is important .
sword swallowing is from ancient india .
in case you &apos;re wondering , this is our strength test .
and when you used to find these things , they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon .
now we have to get through the ice .
we either draw in a liquid sample , or we can actually take a solid core from the wall .
if it existed , it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning .
bob bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit .
to bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed .
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important ,
i &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
and about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike .
i would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation .
if we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself .
if the horse was in pain , i wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
again , if you &apos;re squeamish , you don &apos;t want to watch .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
it &apos;s very powerful work .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and the first thing that i want to talk about , the first thing i think we need to understand is : how do people respond to the epidemic ?
i think it &apos;s possible , if we think about that intuition , and think about that fact , that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change .
so we &apos;re going to need to think about policy and what kind of policies might be effective .
not a lot of other diseases have that profile . and you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in botswana and egypt .
but openness and inter-connectedness , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade .
i think people are very similar , but i also think that we have trouble seeing that .
and they swarm wildly around , kind of exploring the world of life .
we can do an age breakdown , which gives us a histogram of the world &apos;s emotional distribution by age .
&quot; i love how i feel today . &quot;
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .
and we see here a photograph with a head .
we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now .
so it &apos;s been a pleasure . thank you very much .
and they forage maybe for about 20 meters away ,
she feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves .
when it rains in the summer , it floods in the desert .
the queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just lays eggs .
does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing ?
they become foragers .
and it would change as the colony gets larger .
but the idea is that the ants are in there , and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of contacts with other ants .
thank you .
and i had a telephone call from robert lue at harvard , in the molecular and cellular biology department , a couple of years ago . he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard .
and each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around , right now , inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .
and this is a song medley i put together --
an awful lot of bad press --
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search
coincidence ? no , it &apos;s creepy .
i know a coded message when i see one .
we might not ever know .
allison hunt : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
and i got a good look at them . and you know , even i could tell my hip was bad ,
and i saw a sign .
which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all .
now , there are a lot of africans who are very angry , angry at the condition of africa .
every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food .
the second false premise that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people , serves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
now the modern sector , of course , is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into .
it is a total far cry .
that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
you know , we &apos;ve built up reserves . why is that important ?
the economies were not growing .
the issue is how are we using what has been given back .
i walked 10 kilometers , putting one foot in front of the other .
these are people who are productive agents in the economy .
and one day , these foundations have so much money , they will overtake the official aid that is being given .
as a continent , here are our priorities .
if you tell them , &quot; we need a road here , &quot; they will help you build it .
we have ibukun awosika in nigeria , with the chair company .
ca : what , to power -- for lighting and stuff ?
ca : and so , that lit a light for the house ? how many lights ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
the truth is , everything we know about america , everything americans come to know about being american , isn &apos;t from the news .
and everything , all of this is story .
in fact , every time i read in ireland , people get me all mistaken and they say , &quot; oh , this is chris o &apos;barney from cork . &quot;
now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me .
i really don &apos;t care anymore .
and i think if we can just admit that we &apos;re all trying to approximate the truth of our own communities , it will make for a much more nuanced and a much more interesting conversation .
kadoom . kadoom . kadoom .
thankfully , baby was out -- mother and child survived .
and we need to train them right .
it was important not to look at those guns .
and by the way , it &apos;s continued to .
what is it about ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems ? &quot;
but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man .
she won with 75 percent of the vote .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : jacqueline novogratz shares stories of how &quot; patient capital &quot; can bring sustainable jobs , goods , services -- and dignity -- to the world &apos;s poorest .
so let &apos;s -- i did all this training .
and the women said , &quot; it really is . &quot;
i think the market can help us figure that out , but there &apos;s got to be a charitable component , or i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to create the kind of societies we want to live in .
now , some of these same social investors are really interested in africa and understand the importance of agriculture , and they even helped the farmers .
it &apos;s gone from socialist tanzania into capitalist tanzania , and continued to flourish . it had about 1,000 employees when we first found it .
and that some of the channels we thought would work didn &apos;t work .

and opened the kitchen door .
every single thing i planned to say , they have said it here , and it looks and sounds like i have nothing else to say .
and , as a consequence , the western view of africa &apos;s economic dilemma is framed wrongly .
support research institutions , because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation .
and all forms of intervention need support , the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth , the kinds of institutions that increase productivity .
the imf , the world bank , and the cartel of good intentions in the world has taken over our rights as citizens ,
public administration , which is largely patronage , takes 690 billion .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 161 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and it &apos;s not very fun . and when parts of your job are not easy or fun , you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .
it &apos;s steampunk . what we have is an electric velocipede .
you know , that ham butt is delicious ! there &apos;s no reason to throw it away .
i think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts .
newspaper archive goes back to 1759 ,
it can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
so a word without its source is like a cut flower .

thank you .
yes ! so if it doesn &apos;t feel , it will be drowned , ok ?
during the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq .
the criminologist manuel eisner scoured all of the historical records across europe for homicide rates in any village , hamlet , town , county that he could find , and he supplemented them with national data , when nations started keeping statistics .
now , each one of them is thinking , &quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
and this is visible in the unstoppable change in language -- the fact that by the time the academy finishes their dictionary , it will already be well out of date .
unfortunately , there appear to be idiosyncratic exceptions .
these are reminiscent of the kinds of categories that immanuel kant argued are the basic framework for human thought ,
and see human intelligence itself as consisting of a repertoire of concepts -- such as objects , space , time , causation and intention -- which are useful in a social , knowledge-intensive species , whose evolution you can well imagine ,
in which relationships can be categorized , more or less , into communality , which works on the principle &quot; what &apos;s mine is thine , what &apos;s thine is mine , &quot;
if you express your request as a conditional -- &quot; if you could open the window , that would be great &quot; --
&lt; / doc &gt;
so in these two examples , we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simulation , and also machines that learned how to walk in reality .
so of course , this is a very crude machine , but we &apos;re working on a micro-scale version of these , and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .
which leads me to a videotape of a president bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago .
pills alone don &apos;t do it , especially in clinically depressed people .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colonize the milky way .
there &apos;s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the georges bank , or the grand banks off of newfoundland . it &apos;s a no-take fishing zone .
and in my opinion , we don &apos;t spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what &apos;s safe to do on earth .
so , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of mars and spit out the oxygen .
we have a real , major outbreak of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .
astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years .
because we can actually figure out every asteroid that &apos;s out there , and if it might hit earth , and when it might hit earth .
yikes ! so many big threats !
she belongs to the species known as australopithecus afarensis .
with the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks , i made my way .
and here is actually the spinal column and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block , because she was buried by a river .
so when you measure those teeth , it was clear that she turned out to be a girl with very small canine teeth .
it was not known in the fossil record , and we have it in this skeleton .
one is to continue to see a poor , ill , crying africa , carrying guns , that depends on other people forever , or to promote an africa which is confident , peaceful , independent , but cognizant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .
and , in fact , some advantages to owning your own media company .
i then had a bit of a wake-up call when i was 14 .
bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
and there really wasn &apos;t a specific company that was focused on the public interest .
at that point , i thought i knew something about global warming .
in closing , i &apos;d like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way .
not sure of all the details , but excited .
michael moriarty : specialist michael moriarty .
mm : i support george bush . we &apos;re not there for the oil .
and i want to say , i was nervous .
soldier : that &apos;s a fucking car bomb !
they can work on the post for pennies , but can &apos;t die there .
so , i pinged mike and i said , &quot; mike , can you please go get that interview with pink ? &quot;
there &apos;s such a disconnect .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to bring her to see your film .
john maeda : designing for simplicity
so , i turned on the tv , and i don &apos;t watch tv very much , but you know this person ? this is paris hilton , apparently .
modernism means white box , and it &apos;s a perfect white box .
wasn &apos;t she amazing ? muriel cooper . she was wacky .
very good , us humans ! we &apos;re catching up with the computers .
she has this show right now at moma , where some of these early works are here on display at moma , on the walls .
so i focused on food as my area -- in japan , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel just in one piece . who &apos;s done that before ? one-piece clementine ?
so , i thought , maybe i &apos;ll do this for the next twenty years or something .
i love life . i love being alive . i like to see things .
this whole ted effect , it sort of ups your wisdom , somehow .
and interestingly , as i think back , they were the first true environmentalists .
in other words , as i might seek to demonstrate , if you could achieve the impossible , the equivalent of perpetual motion , you could design a carbon-free house , for example .
and that urbanization is extraordinary , accelerated pace .
it anticipated change , even though those changes were not known .
if i made the leap into these new technologies , then how did we -- what happened before that ?
so it would be totally renewable .
we can see the high pressure , the low pressure , the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing .
250 -- excuse me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , i have to bring out four ideas -- it &apos;s like four pieces of a puzzle .
it did not correlate with the size of classrooms .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
so it was a warm day , and the hole in the wall was on that decrepit old building . this is the first kid who came there ;
you know , how on earth did they know all this ?
and this happens very often with these computers , that the younger children are found teaching the older ones .
it seems counter-intuitive to adult learning , but remember , eight-year-olds live in a society where most of the time they are told , don &apos;t do this , you know , don &apos;t touch the whiskey bottle .
but at this point in time , as far as science goes , it &apos;s self-organization .
&lt; / doc &gt;
but then , got off on a vacation trip , and was studying bird flight ,
but while this was going on , in 1982 , i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation -- their annual prize -- and i had to prepare a paper on it , which collected all my varied thoughts
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
paul maccready : the wings could touch together on top and not break . we think .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
larry brilliant : the case for optimism
it will cause rising seas . it will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands .
last year , there were 85,000 riots in china , 230 a day , that required police or military intervention .
a minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas , coupled with increasing flows from the himalayas . and take a look at this .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
now , that doesn &apos;t mean that people understand that global warming hurts the poorest and the weakest the most .
how can that not make you optimistic ?
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .
it &apos;s a condensable in the atmosphere , and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . you can have methane clouds , ok , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface .
and so it &apos;s been tectonically altered .
was this a shoreline of fluids ? we didn &apos;t know .
so it seems that the liquids , for some reason we don &apos;t understand , or during at least this season , are apparently at the poles of titan .
and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we &apos;d forgive you , if you weren &apos;t , ok -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 .
richard branson : thank you very much . the first ted has been great .
and so , you know , so got one secondhand 747 from boeing and gave it a go .
and i think that industries are not quite the same as a result of virgin attacking the market .
what was that ? was that real ?
ca : well , god saved her and you got your just reward .
rb : he &apos;s a wonderful enthusiast , which is why i love him . but ...
rb : well , i knew i had about half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and i also knew that the chances were that if i jumped , i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
rb : well , i won &apos;t contradict that .
did this really happen ?
and then subsequently , &quot; never mind the bollocks , here &apos;s the sex pistols , &quot;
and i like to think that &apos;s how we run virgin .
so , for instance , there &apos;s a doctor in africa that &apos;s found that if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks , when she &apos;s pregnant , that the baby will not have hiv when it &apos;s born .
you &apos;re still doing these incredible new plans .
i &apos;m trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period .
that -- fortunately , there were enough people there , and it was a team , it was a collective , it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas .
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love .
you know , in the course of my life , i never know what &apos;s going to happen and that &apos;s kind of the beauty part .
and it was a phenomenally wonderful event , which we hopefully will do some more .
and then i want to tell you that this is a map .
or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ?
and i went to visit louise bourgeoise , who &apos;s also still working , and i looked at her sink , which is really amazing , and left .
how many of you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
so you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes .
i mean , you have 100 billion nerve cells , little wisps of protoplasm , interacting with each other ,
and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
which you can completely ignore .
tables and chairs and lint , nothing happens , as in normal people ,
it &apos;ll pat his brother on the shoulder , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it rings , it &apos;ll wave goodbye .
well , we said , what if you now send the command to the phantom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obeying his command , right ?
i said , &quot; move your normal hand . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , last three days , i &apos;ve not had a phantom arm and therefore no phantom elbow pain , no clenching , no phantom forearm pain , all those pains are gone away .
c sharp is blue , f sharp is green ,
so , every brain region is wired to every other region ,
in your auditory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- kiki ,
which is to measure their gross national happiness rather than their gross national product .
another notable economist , theodore schultz , in 1974 won the nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers are efficient , but poor .
and i thought that was incredibly peculiar .
africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions , or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions .
and we &apos;re seeing a shift -- powered mainly because of information technology -- a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets .
meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --
so , we are in the business of finding our happiness .
sousa &apos;s fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these , quote , &quot; infernal machines . &quot; they would take it away .
now , at that time , the entity , the legal cartel , that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broadcast using these technologies was ascap .
this one you should be -- confidence . jesus survives . don &apos;t worry .
now , in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies , the law has not greeted this sousa revival with very much common sense .
we don &apos;t have a public domain to draw upon now , so instead what we need is two types of changes .
thank you very much .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : surgeon and author sherwin nuland discusses the development of electroshock therapy as a cure for severe , life-threatening depression -- including his own . it ’ s a moving and heartfelt talk about relief , redemption and second chances .
someone who is , as the italians say , &quot; cagoots . &quot; so they found this &quot; cagoots &quot; guy , a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic , who was known , had been known for months , to be literally defecating on himself , talking nothing that made any sense ,
i &apos;m telling you this story , because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his speakers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience ,
that proved to be a lot of bovine stercus .
it was impossible . so they decided there was no therapy , there was no treatment . but there was one treatment , which actually had been pioneered at the hartford hospital in the early 1940s ,
that i was now strong enough that by an act of will , i could blow the obsessional thinking away .
resuscitated the career , even better than it had been before .
accidents happen . something from childhood comes back to haunt you .
it &apos;s not in the lab ,
ok , that &apos;s fair enough .
i think , quite a nice feature .
so , the u.n. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who can &apos;t read and write , worldwide .
and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure , they wouldn &apos;t necessarily be considered viable customers , because they &apos;re not wealthy enough to have bank accounts .
and i know what you &apos;re asking -- did i test it ?
it &apos;s all about the dots joining together .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? biochemist turned buddhist monk matthieu ricard says we can train our minds in habits of well-being , to generate a true sense of serenity and fulfillment .
as pascal said , even the one who hangs himself , somehow , is looking for cessation of suffering . he finds no other way .
and happiness , of course , is such a vague word , so let &apos;s say well-being .
isn &apos;t it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering ?
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
so what we need to look for now is , instead of looking outward , we look inward .
so what did they find ? of course , same thing .
it &apos;s more to say that mind training matters . that this is not just a luxury .
you &apos;ve all seen lots of articles on climate change ,
cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
but you &apos;ll notice that in the upper bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit .
the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering .
there are a lot of fun complexities that i &apos;d love to spend the whole evening on , but i won &apos;t .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs .
but here &apos;s a case which is harder to reject .
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
so we &apos;ve been planting stuff for 11,000 years . and
agriculture over a century , agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier . yeah , the plows look different . the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules , but the farmer would have understood : this is what the guy &apos;s doing , this is why he &apos;s doing it , this is where he &apos;s going . what
you &apos;re producing a biogas out of coal in some mines , but not in others .
this is what accumulates in the tar sands of alberta . these are sulfur blocks . because as you separate that petroleum from the sand , and use an enormous amount of energy inside that vapor -- steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sulfur . the difference between light crude and heavy crude -- well , it &apos;s about 14 bucks a barrel . that &apos;s why you &apos;re building these pyramids of sulfur blocks . and by the way , the
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway .
here &apos;s an example of this similarity .
the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that .
that was a big unification for those days , although today we take it for granted .
you don &apos;t need something more in order to get something more .
the problem is , there are many , many feet .
without a foot , here &apos;s what it does . it doesn &apos;t even slow down .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
they &apos;re tuned such that they easily collapse in one direction to pull the leg out from debris , but they &apos;re stiff in the other direction so they capture disparities in the surface .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look -- and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grabbing on the surface .
this is when its foot &apos;s in the air .
and each hair has the worst case of split ends possible .
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; robot in scansorial environment &quot; -- that &apos;s a climbing environment --
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sped up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and rescue somebody at that upper floor ? ok ?
♫ i &apos;ll watch it tonight on my &apos; pod ♫ ♫ and now all of the networks are joining in ♫ ♫ two bucks a show without ads ♫ ♫ it &apos;s a business those guys always wanted to try ♫ ♫ but only steve jobs had the &apos; nads ♫ ♫ they say we &apos;re young , don &apos;t watch tv ♫ ♫ they say the internet is all we see ♫ ♫ but that &apos;s not true ; they &apos;ve got it wrong ♫
i don &apos;t try to design the toothbrush .
even , i think , we copy our way to reproduce , you know what i mean ,
the more you will rise , to see far and high , like that , the more you will be important for the story of our mutation .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radicalization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
now , mathematicians thought this was very strange because as you shrink a ruler down , you measure a longer and longer length .
and it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle , and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here .
and i started to realize that the cycles of fertility were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this .
and three times , the answer is no .
it &apos;s called mancala here on the east coast , bao in kenya , sogo elsewhere .
and they did this very rapidly , and i couldn &apos;t understand where they were getting -- they only did the randomness four times -- i couldn &apos;t understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols .
in the 12th century , hugo of santalla brought it from islamic mystics into spain .
i didn &apos;t put his name up here -- my colleague , kerry , in kenya , has come up with this great idea for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : in a lively show , mathemagician arthur benjamin races a team of calculators to figure out 3-digit squares , solves another massive mental equation and guesses a few birthdays . how does he do it ? he ’ ll tell you .
that &apos;s ok .
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
i &apos;m going to try to square a four-digit number this time .
one digit at a time , i shall try and determine the digit you &apos;ve left out .
1959 , ok -- and the month ?
ab : and what month ?
while i explain something else -- -- i know , that you can use , right ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
but then the question is : why don &apos;t we ?
at any rate , at one point my brother-in-law , leonard , decided to write a book about a serial killer .
and it &apos;s well known by epidemiologists that kids who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia .
and so i &apos;m optimistic .
but too late .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : at ted u , gever tulley , founder of the tinkering school , spells out 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do -- and why a little danger is good for both kids and grownups .
whether we remember it or not , it &apos;s the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things .
but when you exercise them , any given muscle adds strength to the whole system , and that applies to your brain , too .
and that really gives them a handle on a world in a way that they don &apos;t often have access to .
and i think this picture inspired chris to insert me into the lateral thinking session .
and this research is being precipitated by the u.s. government , so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes .
i &apos;m here to tell you a few tales of passion .
a speck of snow , an inch of ice , the force of the wind , can determine the result of a race or a game .
sophia is over 70 and she looks great .
the protagonists of this story are a young woman , rose mapendo , and her children .
they have no education and no freedom .
the woman &apos;s face looks like a watermelon .
what kind of world do we want ?
i want to make this world good .
cephalopods -- head-foots . as a kid i knew them as calamari , mostly .
but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin .
&lt; speaker &gt; paola antonelli &lt; / speaker &gt;
the exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do homeworks at home ?
but design , for some reason , is still misunderstood for decoration .
there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life .
i would like , instead , to talk about how great some designers are .
and the police is reminded ; it &apos;s like having a flower in front of the rifle .
and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks .
i wanted to show you , for instance , the work of mathieu lehanneur , which is quite fantastic .
but there it is : &quot; jó napot , pacák &quot;
he built one plant after another .
&quot; good . buy us some land in kings mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there . &quot;
to me , it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit of this little methodist college in upstate south carolina was a holocaust survivor from central europe .
it was he who broke the mayan codex , enabling scholars to relate the pictographs on mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the mayan script .
&quot; learn as if you &apos;ll live forever . &quot;
kind of minding my own business . and there was this artist teaching ,
manchester craftsmen &apos;s guild is named after my neighborhood .
i said to my boy , &quot; when you raise the money , we &apos;ll put your taste on the wall . &quot;
that happens to be at christmas time .
that happens to be our cafeteria line .
and we train chemical technicians for companies like bayer and calgon carbon and fisher scientific and exxon .
for that i won a big old plaque -- man of the year in education .
you have to tone down the jesus stuff a little bit , but keep the enthusiasm .
and i said , &quot; you &apos;re in the computer business , is that right ? &quot;
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city .
we are currently number four on the billboard charts , right behind tony bennett .
and we got the funding and we open in the fall .
and now i really want to build one . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , i met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card . &quot;
and quincy said , &quot; where did the idea for centers like this come from ? &quot;
you &apos;re always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money , too much need --
and i was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism ,
so , the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism ;
suddenly i was becoming sort of acceptable , which i found also fascinating .
i was also making a tv series for the bbc at the time .
tony blair and cherie . and again , the legalities -- we had to be very careful .
tony blair being used as a mounting block ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 211 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing .
madame de gaulle , the wife of the french president , was famously asked once , &quot; what do you most desire ? &quot;
it &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ... it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body massage .
and more important , i think , the ideas that are exhibited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use , because there &apos;s fantastic synergy .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand . &quot;
in london , the day they turned the congestion pricing on , there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight , and that &apos;s persisted for the four years in which they &apos;ve been doing congestion pricing .
and this is a moment from &quot; the graduate . &quot; do you remember this moment ?
there isn &apos;t anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities , to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there &apos;s zero ongoing communications cost .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
during many years , i made some speeches starting with this saying : &quot; city is not a problem , it &apos;s a solution . &quot;
oaxaca , san francisco -- it &apos;s very easy : market street , van ness and the waterfront .
-- that &apos;s why when we &apos;re talking about sustainability , it &apos;s not enough , green buildings .
i would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what &apos;s said , but don &apos;t forget the cities and the children .
and this is an acupuncture note -- or i.m. pei &apos;s . some small ones can make the city better .
and tell you about a tool , a very simple tool that i have found .
and i had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country , brought it , and i was planting it .
so i started looking at things this way
and that &apos;s another very important thing it does .
and the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today , to me , is the final triumph of corn over good sense . it is part of corn &apos;s scheme for world domination .
cows graze one day . they move , ok ?
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ... again , give each species what it wants ,
when we really begin to feel darwin &apos;s insights in our bones , the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hopeful about .
not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home , driving into risd everyday , driving back .
here &apos;s a little map . and i thought of maps at the beginning ;
a nice way to show that river , that stream sort of pouring down the hill .
so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion .
he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring , and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building , apartment by apartment , checking every television , checking every connection , hoping to find out what this problem is .
but more importantly , i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco , which is more often the case .
and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things ,
so , we circle around the coliseum , past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these paragraphs .
although they must have solved some collective action problems ;
more recently , that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops ,
now , the fundamental basis of neoclassical economics would tell you it &apos;s irrational to reject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment may be the glue that holds societies together .
that &apos;s folding @ home at stanford --
thank you .
you can &apos;t open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course .
ideas get shorter . they become sound bytes .
they have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator .
they told her she couldn &apos;t love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing .
three years ago , agnes opened a safe house in africa to stop mutilation .
the end goal will &#91; be &#93; becoming vulnerable , realizing the place of our connection to one another , rather than becoming secure , in control and alone .
well , what i &apos;m doing is controlling the pitch with my left hand .
it really does reflect the mood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ... it &apos;s similar to being a vocalist , except instead of it coming out of your throat ,
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that .
every wall , every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building .
and i went down and chief minister badal said to me , &quot; we sikhs have suffered a great deal , as you have jews .
i was renamed safdie singh . and there it is under construction ;
the first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on , conference centers , a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking -- and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition , the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry .
thank you very much .
i got a scholarship to st. lawrence university , upstate new york ;
and it &apos;s a really poor area . i represent northern kenya : the most nomadic , remote areas you can even find .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 221 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture .
which meant that it was all secret .
they got quite serious about the engineering of this .
and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out , and everybody says , &quot; well , what are we going to do ? &quot;
and little did i know that one year later ... ♫ we &apos;d be doing this show . ♫ ♫ sobule : i sing . sweeney : i tell stories . together : the jill and julia show . ♫ sobule : hey , they asked us back ! sweeney : can you stand it ? ! ♫ together : the jill and julia , the jill and julia , the jill and julia show . ♫ ♫ sobule : why are all our heroes so imperfect ? ♫
on a scientific basis , it &apos;s more than just &quot; power of positive thinking &quot; -- it has a horrible , horrible dark side . like if you get ill , it &apos;s because you &apos;ve just been thinking negative thoughts .
yeah , look at this . you know , all kinds of different ... ted is about invention , let &apos;s be honest . right ? dh : yeah , it is .
bf : you know , over the years , every year at the conference , it &apos;s kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with richard . and we &apos;ve always done something with the bullwhips in our act . it &apos;s funny , for years i did it with daniel holding balloons .
ok .
dh : true . barry ... bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
bf : no , she &apos;s got ... farm animal .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready .
bf : nice .
dh : we will juggle seven .
it &apos;s going to change the way we do astronomy , it &apos;s going to change the way we teach astronomy and i think most importantly it &apos;s going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe .
before i introduce the person responsible for the worldwide telescope , i just want to leave you with this brief thought :
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 225 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and if we can run the video , i &apos;ll show you what it took to get this dreamworks shot .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 228 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , i didn &apos;t like that at all .
so they had created these artifacts .
and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object ,
they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
so what i &apos;m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . and they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time ,
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface ,
because i was performing this type of research during the day , but then in the evenings and on the weekends , i traveled as an advocate for nami , the national alliance on mental illness .
our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
and i &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and i realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down .
and i felt this sense of peacefulness .
in the meantime , for 45 minutes , the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere .
but then i realized , &quot; but i &apos;m still alive ! i &apos;m still alive , and i have found nirvana .

there are actually ways of getting rid of them ,
so this slide is a fake slide .
and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly and it just scoots across the screen .
now , that would be , if you will , the top green track , which doesn &apos;t mean too much . but you might have to elaborate for me or for somebody who isn &apos;t an expert , and say , &quot; cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes . &quot;
repairman : ... not too far out . front poles , preferably .
and you obviously have been hoodwinked or you &apos;ve talked about somebody else . &quot;
on the other hand , you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer
and when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a bathroom or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . and you point frequently to the empty seat and you say , &quot; he or she wouldn &apos;t agree , &quot;
and , i get a lot of flak for this at cambridge .
and he wasn &apos;t doing that . he was scribbling with chalk on the pavement .
and she &apos;s now in her 80s .
and if they collide , it would look a lot like the big bang .
as i pursued my career , something was always gnawing away inside me .
my parents were both elected to the first parliament , alongside nelson and winnie mandela . they were the only other couple .
and bright young africans are desperate to join the global community , to be successful -- and they &apos;re very ambitious .
we illustrate aims &apos; progress by coloring in the countries of africa .
so all in all i have a very good ph.d. student from south africa .
our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african . in striving for the heights of creative genius , we want to give thousands of people the motivation , the encouragement and the courage to obtain the high-level skills they need to help africa .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspiring they were , and they were really sort of the most hard-working and constantly inspiring people i knew .
so , we had this place , we rented it , the landlord was all for it . we did this mural , that &apos;s a chris ware mural , that basically explains the entire history of the printed word , in mural form -- it takes a long time to digest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we waited .
first of all , it was a pirate supply store , which is insane .
then we said , &quot; well , what are we going to do with the space during the day ,
so then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
so we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stores . the store , actually -- even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money .
these are all sort of repurposed other products , or whatever .
this is one of the students , khaled hamdan .
now i &apos;m going to the ted wish -- is that okay ?
students and parents need you . they need your actual person : your physical personhood and your open minds and open ears and boundless compassion , sitting next to them , listening and nodding and asking questions for hours at a time .
i &apos;d seen judaism only as a kind of prelude to christianity , and i knew nothing about islam at all .
and it was -- the golden rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called &quot; ren , &quot; human-heartedness , which was a transcendent experience in itself .
there &apos;s also a great deal , i think , of religious illiteracy around .
you know the story of &quot; the iliad , &quot; the 10-year war between greece and troy .
the importance of this is that this is -- i can see some of you starting to look worried , because you think it &apos;s a slow and cumbersome body -- but what the united nations can do is give us some neutrality , so that this isn &apos;t seen as a western or a christian initiative , but that it &apos;s coming , as it were , from the united nations , from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureaucracy of this .
en face or three-quarters .
i couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when i first saw that .
&lt; speaker &gt; christopher decharms &lt; / speaker &gt;
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
so , i &apos;m not going to talk about that .
what i ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
could somebody put this guy up ?
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
none of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
it &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . i measure its wavelength .
there &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
a dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
now we have the good fortune to open up space .
. thank you , chris .
and the old lady said , &quot; oh yes , come on in . &quot;
why did the universe emerge from the big bang the way it did ?
why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos ?
ca : professor hawking , thank you for that answer .
in order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis .
that puts a lot of pressure on greenland .
from laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials .
but geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis
we need help . we need help .
so , as researchers , something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities , or achieve certain goals .
another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots , so this is actually a multi-touch , interactive whiteboard system as well .
so , that &apos;s my first idea . and we all know about the mozart effect -- the idea that &apos;s been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby &#91; in utero &#93; , that it &apos;ll raise our iq points 10 , 20 , 30 percent .
it &apos;s very , very important .
it &apos;s the activity that seems to accelerate people &apos;s treatment the most
and then they can also , when you snap , line up exactly the way you &apos;d like to .
he &apos;s very shy , too .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely composed by dan in hyperscore .
yochai benkler : the new open-source economics
capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we &apos;ve got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major input --
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing -- the decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page rank .
you don &apos;t have to ask permission , as you do in a property-based system .
i will deliver something based on what happens . it &apos;s very scary -- that &apos;s what google does , essentially .
and in paris , the ipcc released its study confirming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
the real question : is this distorted worldview what we want for americans in our increasingly interconnected world ?
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am i , why am i this particular person , why am i not black like everybody else ?
and this , then , led to my big questions .
there is also a big question of ambiguity .
that is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called &quot; saving fish from drowning . &quot;
not all of us can go to africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
another chance encounter is when i went to a place -- i just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine .
the man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good , because then i will discover something new .
this is a year when einstein is basking in the glow of having discovered the special theory of relativity and decides to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the grand , pervasive force of gravity .
and that is what got kaluza thinking .
we don &apos;t seem to see them .
superstring theory -- what is it ? well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?
it doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six .
this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape -- name isn &apos;t all that important .
so , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton -- that &apos;s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
now , there &apos;s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achievement .
and when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simplification . but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang --
they then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
we have now entered in the 6x , the sixth major extinction on this planet .
after they sporulate , they do rot .
when you walk across landscapes , it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris .
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an asteroid impact .
the enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars .
this mushroom grows in washington state , oregon , northern california , british columbia , now thought to be extinct in europe .
i became interested in entomopathogenic fungi -- fungi that kill insects .
this could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world .
i think engaging mycelium can help save the world .
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on host mobility at all for transmission .
remember the second question that i raised at the outset was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild ?
there &apos;s a little ethical problem in this experiment .
they evolved to produce less toxin .
so , we can go to the same countries and look and see . did chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance ,
and there &apos;s a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this .
but that &apos;s when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness .
so the other thing i really like about this , besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension into the study of control of disease , is that often the kinds of interventions that you want , that it indicates should be done , are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow .
and after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; look , you know , you gotta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the vending machine . &quot;
so bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers .
and were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week , these crows , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these crows would caw at them , and run around and make their life kind of miserable .
which is really useful if you live in a city .
crows , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
i write about food . i write about cooking .
there &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
another red herring might be exemplified by the word &quot; locavore , &quot; which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary .
you just ate .
if we had a slide of salisbury steak , even more so , right ?
this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
meat , junk food , cheese :
the most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat , on average , twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed usda recommends .
less meat , less junk , more plants .
why ? why are we looking up ? is it because it &apos;s heaven ?
and we &apos;re leaving so much on the table , 72 percent of the planet .
and like a living organism , you tear it open , it bleeds its molten blood , rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere , hardens , forms new tissue and moves laterally .
and so we went along this mountain range , in an area along galapagos rift , and did we find the missing heat .
they came across new creatures they had not seen before .
and yet we &apos;re only now penetrating it .
and i was looking at it yesterday , it &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
we have stiff competition and we need to motivate and it &apos;s all being done .
i mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier .
it wasn &apos;t what i wanted to do .
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustainability , about lower power consumption .
this is called y water , and it &apos;s this guy from los angeles , thomas arndt , austrian originally , who came to us ,
so , i was convinced . we designed it to be iconic , to look different . to look like it &apos;s for a kid , but not like a toy .
i mean , they &apos;re being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere .
i would make things for people as a way of , you know , giving , showing them my love .
that &apos;s pretty ambiguous .
for me , it &apos;s kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment , and i wanted to express that .
and , in a case like this , i &apos;m trying to make something which is clear but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant .
and when i had this thought , i was imagining that i would make -- i would have a whole machine theater evening , where i would -- you would have an audience , the curtain would open , and you &apos;d be entertained by machines on stage .
and by the time i was an intern house officer , i could barely afford to maintain my mother &apos;s 13-year-old car --
what &apos;s the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled ?
we all went out and did a mission and we &apos;ve done three of them so far .
well , nowadays everything &apos;s on pax anyway .
and that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
and lots and lots of that little bit down there , sacrifice .
do you think there could ?
sb : chaos ? no . what ? mind ? no .
all around us , still clumsily drifting about in its primeval soup of culture , is another replicator .
all right everyone , who &apos;s got some interesting memes for me ?
it &apos;s not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your bathrooms here .
copying with variation and selection .
and we &apos;re getting there .
the fraction of those that get the second replicator .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy output for two percent of your body weight ?
and why would they do that ? because we are self-replicating .
paul collier : the &quot; bottom billion &quot;
europe had to be dragged into economic development .
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .
and the short run -- say , the first five to seven years -- is just great .
now , there &apos;s one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s , and that is the spread of democracy .
and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction .
. however , i have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me .
so , literally , a few minutes before that , i downloaded this scientific paper about calculations on avian defecation , which is really quite interesting , because it turns out you can model this as something called &quot; poiseuille flow , &quot; and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the avian rectum .
and then i met yoyo , who is the native rapa nui-an guide ,
not a joke .
we do a lot of work in biomedical fields .
so , the jodie foster character here is actually this woman , jill tarter ,
so , you hike around and -- this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
here &apos;s a picture i took in the falkland islands of king penguins on a beach .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and that &apos;s the ultimate disobedience to authority .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera ,
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad apples .
people say , &quot; no , that &apos;s nazi germany , hitler , you know , that &apos;s 1939 . &quot; he said , &quot; yeah , but suppose hitler asked you , &apos; would you electrocute a stranger ? &apos; &apos; no way , i &apos;m a good person . &apos; &quot;
and the question is , who would go all the way to 450 volts ?
i did this study with my graduate students , especially craig haney -- and it also began work with an ad .
they begin to do degrading activities , like having them simulate sodomy .
passive tolerance of evil through inaction , or indifference .
so i want to end very quickly on a positive note . heroism as the antidote to evil ,
most people are guilty of the evil of inaction , because your mother said , &quot; don &apos;t get involved . mind your own business . &quot;
and so one day , you will be in a new situation .
by the time the last neanderthal disappeared in europe , 27,000 years ago , our direct ancestors had already , and for 5,000 years , been crawling into the belly of the earth , where in the light of the flickers of tallow candles , they had brought into being the great art of the upper paleolithic .
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea .
the cause of suffering is ignorance .
it &apos;s kind of like an andean woodstock : 60,000 indians on pilgrimage to the end of a dirt road that leads to the sacred valley , called the sinakara , which is dominated by three tongues of the great glacier .
now , the measure of a society is not only what it does , but the quality of its aspirations .
not simply to the flanks of the mountains , but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims .
two hours from miami , there is an entire civilization of people praying every day for your well-being .
and there is indeed a fire burning over the earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the legacy of humanity &apos;s brilliance .
but you get these resources together .
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fraction of them have photos of the mermaid parade .
what flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination .
and by the time you get to the middle , you &apos;ve got hundreds of people who have contributed only one photo each .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
the bigger question is , what do you do about the value down here ?
and i use that word advisedly .
they even have lance armstrong-style bracelets , these red bracelets , which signify , in the small group , i am trying to maintain my eating disorder .
and so the point here is not , &quot; this is wonderful , &quot; or &quot; we &apos;re going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooperative framework . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
and three of the smartest people were stan ulam , richard feynman and john von neumann . and it was von neumann who said , after the bomb , he was working on something much more important than bombs : he &apos;s thinking about computers .

i see some of you recognize this child .
i moved his body while he was playing .
and the telephone . the telephone . if your mother calls on the miserable telephone , she calls and says , &quot; hello , &quot; you not only know who it is , you know what mood she &apos;s in .
composers know that . if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
that chord doesn &apos;t work .

and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the baton on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project . something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how techie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it . ok ?
it allows you to team up with people . the u.n. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announcing this with kofi annan was very important , and the u.n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met yves behar .
because it &apos;s cheap , in the pejorative sense , as well as inexpensive .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , &quot; well , let &apos;s get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; and that &apos;s where you come in .
and the world production today , everybody combined , making laptops , is five million a month . so i &apos;m standing here telling you that sometime next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .

as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation -- in the &apos; 80s -- of students who were protesting a military dictatorship , which has finally ended .

and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists , i always hope that when my pictures were published , they might actually have an effect on a situation , instead of just documenting it .
the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bricks under the floors , so the heat actually radiates from underneath the floor .
they would actually cover the windows every night , so that light couldn &apos;t be seen , because the south korean government has said for years that the north koreans may invade at any time .
and my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her .
i said , &quot; well , tell him that i was asked by this little girl &apos;s grandmother to find a family for her . &quot;
so , these two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
this is father keene . he &apos;s just a wonderful guy .
they really wanted to be able to welcome hyun-sook into their family .
so , sure enough , it &apos;s one o &apos;clock , room &apos;s freezing , i go to close the window , and i hear people shouting outside , and i thought , &quot; oh , the bars must have just gotten out . &quot;
and gene , who &apos;s lying on the floor , says , &quot; man , we &apos;ve got to soak towels . &quot; i said , &quot; what ? &quot;

to produce these animations , an animator at a studio has to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen in the actual game , and then has to animate that particular sequence .
you hook these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further ,
first , starting with a push from the right .
so this character is going to be hit by a force , it &apos;s going to realize it &apos;s in the air , and it &apos;s going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it &apos;s landing .

the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
it was the best month of my life , because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bible literally ?
that one i followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip .
and i said , &quot; well , that would be great ! &quot;
it &apos;s just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the bible that they distort all the data to fit their model .
after three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he &apos;s like , &quot; i gotta go . &quot;
you have to pick and choose . and anyone who follows the bible is going to be picking and choosing .

we forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier , more fulfilled , more productive . and &quot; genius , &quot; &quot; high-talent , &quot; became a dirty word .
each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends .
it &apos;s all like french vanilla ice cream , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you &apos;re down to the sixth taste , it &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re one with the music . time stops .
so we do random assignment , placebo controlled , long-term studies of different interventions .
and our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought .
but once you fractionate happiness the way i do -- not just positive emotion , that &apos;s not nearly enough -- there &apos;s flow in life , and there &apos;s meaning in life .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products , away from the ethnic , a little bit more contemporary .
we are the species called homo sapiens sapiens , and it &apos;s important to remember that , in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth .
not many people can say that .

but also , surprising finds recently announced from the island of flores in indonesia , where a group of these human ancestors have been isolated , and have become dwarfed , and they &apos;re only about a meter in height .
you can see here , again , taken from al gore &apos;s book . but what &apos;s happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth .
anyway , it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories .

you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside .
this is the whaling camp here , we &apos;re about six miles from shore ,
and so i thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories . so , in the case of &quot; the whale hunt , &quot; how could we extract something like the story of simeon and crawford , involving the concepts of wildlife , tools and blood , taking place on the arctic ocean , dominated by the color red , happening around 10 a.m. on may 3 , with an excitement level of high ?
and we could do something as arbitrary as , say , extract the story of rony , involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools , taking place on the arctic ocean , at ahkivgaq camp , with the heartbeat level of fast .
and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life , what makes them happy .

because if architecture is what i believe it to be , which is the built form of our cultural ambitions , what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else &apos;s cultural ambitions relative to us ?
in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large , technical answer that can solve all problems , be they social , be they physical , be they chemical -- or something that &apos;s more of a romantic solution .

of course , the memory is really huge .
and everything will go through the web .
the reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them ,
we &apos;re now entering to the third stage , which is what i &apos;m talking about , and that is where we link the data .

so the next 5,000 days , it &apos;s not going to be the web and only better .

but because gravitationally attracting matter is embedded in this space , it tends to slow down the expansion of the space , ok .
so by looking at things like clusters of galaxies , and how they -- their number density , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compete against each other in structure forming .
and finally , for future endeavors , there are telescopes being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- ground-based telescopes , and there are three space-based telescopes that are in competition right now to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy .
forward , don &apos;t move the wrist .
so we have an agreement .
impressive . thank you .
i &apos;m joking , yeah ?
then you have to push it down again .
very quick , but in slow motion , so you can follow .
this is a tough one , because here i must take advantage of -- i switch it with the five of clubs .

so , at this point , the dog knows what we want it to do .
so we really motivate the dog to want to do it , such that the need for punishment seldom comes up .
when the dog would try to leave the mat , she would say , &quot; rover , on the mat , on the mat , on the mat . &quot;
the dog says , &quot; i don &apos;t think so . &quot;
and this is what it &apos;s all about .

john q. walker : great piano performances , recreated
his maybe most famous recording was something called &quot; the goldberg variations . &quot;
and i got to tell you , if you haven &apos;t heard high-definition surround , go down to your audio dealer , your audiophile dealer .
all right , there &apos;s this episode of &quot; star trek . &quot;
it &apos;s a way better experience than whatever you &apos;re used to listening to , in whatever form .

and like many african families , my parents could never save because they supported siblings , cousins , you know , their parents ,
they called me two weeks later , they &apos;re like , oh , yeah , you can come now . and i told them to stuff it .
you don &apos;t see the blogger , you don &apos;t see the harvard-educated lawyer , the vibrant person , you know ?
and after all the hoopla of live 8 , we &apos;re still not anywhere in the picture .
what are they doing ?
and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me ,
and the change starts with us .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
and for molecular programming , the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing ?
and they &apos;re floppy when they &apos;re single-stranded .
and you can see a little bit of double helix forming there .
and you can make a map of the americas and spell dna with dna . and what &apos;s really neat about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nano-artwork ,
we &apos;re going to turn to another technology ,
and the neat thing about it is , is that it &apos;s also reprogrammable .
so it &apos;s got some errors , but at least it counts up .
and i find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better than the other audiences , which is somewhat surprising .
and so , there &apos;s a whole lot of people saying , &quot; i &apos;d be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air .
if you believe , as most of you probably do , that it &apos;s hotter in summer than in winter because we &apos;re closer to the sun , you must have drawn an ellipse .
there &apos;s no passion in it , and it &apos;s not hands on , right ,
your homework is -- you know , how does an aircraft &apos;s wing create lift ?
sw : much better . well , einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 , amongst all you modern-day einsteins . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fell down .

that is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening .
they do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures , many of which are similar , or even identical , to ours and formed in the same context . greeting chimpanzees embracing .
perhaps build some schoolrooms .
and yet we &apos;re destroying the only home we have .
i asked a question . &quot; why ? &quot;
just picking one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoots groups are doing , one or two projects only -- in tanzania , in uganda , kenya , south africa , congo-brazzaville , sierra leone , cameroon and other groups . and as i say , it &apos;s in 97 countries around the world .
and choose to make these choices with the question , how will this affect the environment around me ?
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who &apos;s running this entire conference center , i met her today .
you can understand why artists are so different from accountants .
when the liberal team loses , as it did in 2004 , and as it almost did in 2000 , we comfort ourselves .
we &apos;re all mammals here , we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the weak and vulnerable .
i think this is what we come with , at least a preparedness to learn all of these things .
i &apos;ll just flip through a few other slides .
some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 60s .
some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere , in part for the purpose of trusting each other , and then being more effective at competing with other groups .
if you &apos;re high in openness to experience , revolution is good , it &apos;s change , it &apos;s fun .
so , what &apos;s the point ? what should you do ?

of the united states and the soviet union .
now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration , we engaged in america in a series -- and in fact , in the soviet union -- in a series of response planning .
turns out that they had another idea behind it , even though this was -- they were telling the public it was to save us .
and , in fact , lots of sites where fissionable materials , like highly enriched uranium and plutonium , are absolutely not safe .
there &apos;s detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts .
five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent .
here we go . ok .
over the next few days to a week , there will be a radiation cloud , again , going with the wind , and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case , over long island .
and shelter and place . you want to move &#91; only &#93; crosswind for 1.2 miles .
this is arguably the back end of the design of animals .
and they said , &quot; ah , no problem ! we just get out and walk . &quot;
go underneath it . go above it . go around it .
it &apos;s this hair that &apos;s above the eyes , and below it , it &apos;s longer .

we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
it costs about three dollars to download , print and bind a normal , old book .
something else i &apos;m quite excited about in this particular domain , beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little screens that are coming out .
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these auto-page-turning things .
and we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright into the out-of-print world .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day .
and we &apos;ve got , now , a lot of these materials .
how do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future , just as we basically benefited as we were growing up ?
i said , &quot; you &apos;re a peach , ma . pop there ? &quot;
there are stories you tell from stages .
i called my mother , and she said , &quot; carmen , i need you to come , please .
and she &apos;s jingling , jangling a pair of keys .
and so we left my father fast asleep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by herself , and we get in the car .
so i look up and i &apos;m thinking , maybe he &apos;s still going to think i &apos;m kind of cute . &quot;
&quot; it will upset you . &quot;
she has amazing land speed for a woman her age , too .
there she is .
&quot; i &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
the boy , now , he says . &quot; well , what my sister meant &quot; -- they look at each other , it &apos;s a knowing glance -- &quot; god , she &apos;s crazy ! &quot;
everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
one of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
and what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick . we &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
it &apos;s because of the way the government commodifies food ,
we really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .
you know , run up into the end of the rainbow ,
so we &apos;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system .
you know , it &apos;s crazy . it &apos;s crazy what we &apos;re doing .
you know what ? we should be ashamed .
and i asked myself , why ?
you could abuse it .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 351 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and then notice that a great many of these problems disappear .
i think the big problem is that we &apos;re not smart enough to understand which of the problems we &apos;re facing are good enough .
and so there won &apos;t be any workforce .
thank you .
what &apos;s the single most important thing you &apos;ve got to convey ? what ?
and you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going .
i need to know you have the ability to listen .
you stop , you need to figure out a nice , logical progression .
one may have been gross sales , one may have been net sales , but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together .
what do you do ? best of all , images . just a simple image .
if it &apos;s a website , show me a screenshot of your website .
we &apos;ll have 1,000 customers this year and 10,000 the next ,
so how do i know what &apos;s going on ?

well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random .
also , even if we were born with certain ignoble motives , they don &apos;t automatically lead to ignoble behavior .
so let me tell you what aroused such irate responses , and i &apos;ll let you decide if whether they -- the claims are really that outrageous .
well , here &apos;s a diagnosis .
well , the other hot button is parenting .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or topics , are to be considered taboos , forbidden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them honestly .
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robotics , where you put a pc on , and you program this thing with a gui to wander around your house and do various stuff .
on board that robot is a pc running linux .
very hostile environments , 150 ˚ c , 10,000 psi .
i just want to show you one technical diagram here .
and when i was dealing with my robot over here , chris , the robot , was measuring the prosody in my voice ,
i want to show you my watch . &quot; and he brings the watch center , into the robot &apos;s field of vision , points to it , gives it a motion cue , and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully .
150 years ago , with darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals .
i was here about four years ago , talking about the relationship of design and happiness .
everybody participated -- milton glaser ,
in the space of conceptual design .
you can show a mosque , or you can show worshippers , but there &apos;s not a straightforward way of depicting islam .
so the risks are very great .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of .
so , the drill was mounted on this robotic arm .
then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall .
so , this is the entrance to tully hall as it used to be , before the renovation , which we just started .
but one more added feature .
and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience , change became not only possible , but inevitable .
the school i went to was pretty boring .
the graphics were just horrible .

and i walked out , and this really miraculous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air filter , which was that the streets were completely alive with people .
everybody contributes a little bit .
but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it , and google just sitting there and running the numbers .
there &apos;s a problem with the google zeitgeist ,
you can see we &apos;re in the ascot , which is always good .
and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs .

obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . if anyone tells you that there is a single-factor explanation for societal collapses , you know right away that they &apos;re an idiot . this is a complex subject . but how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject ?
long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture , and to no government regulation ; values that worked well in the past , but they don &apos;t seem to be working well today .
to do what &apos;s called flogging the land : overstocking the land , forcing tenant farmers into dependency . and that made

in fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contributes to unhappiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
it happens also , actually , in the most recent book i wrote , called &quot; good business , &quot; where i interviewed some of the ceos who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful and very ethical , very socially responsible .
and then the other areas become less and less positive .

it &apos;s going to push this energy limit seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before ,
and it seems strange that nature would have so many elementary particles .
so these patterns of charges are not just pretty .
this particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory introduced by pati and salam in 1973 .
from their location in this pattern , we know that these new particles should be scalar fields like the higgs particle , but have color charge and interact with the strong force .
in this regard , new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies .
so are you saying that we should think of the universe , at its heart -- that the smallest things that there are , are somehow an e8 object of possibility ?

and before i launch into the display of some of the slides and into the preview , i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design .
in this case too , you have a mixture of scientists and designers .
you see here the work of ben fry . this is &quot; human vs. chimps &quot; -- the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps .
it used to be called rapid prototyping , rapid modeling .

and this is hedy lamarr .
this is filippino lippi &apos;s 1543 portrait of saint apollonia .

this is from &quot; triumph of the will &quot; -- brilliant editing to cut together things .
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .
so , within that larger context , we can talk about diet , stress management -- which are really these spiritual practices --
the younger brother is 86 , the older one ’ s 95 ; they wanted to show me how much more flexible they were .
what was the biggest selling drug of all time
and if you see from &apos; 85 to &apos; 86 to &apos; 87 , &apos; 88 , &apos; 89 , &apos; 90 , &apos; 91 -- you get a new category , 15 to 20 percent ; &apos; 92 , &apos; 93 , &apos; 94 , &apos; 95 , &apos; 96 , &apos; 97 -- you get a new category ; &apos; 98 , &apos; 99 , 2000 , and 2001 .
so , and you get all the disease-protective substances .
so , an optimal diet is low in fat , low in the bad carbs , high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats .
it can be sexual intimacy – i happen to think that healing energy and erotic energy are just different forms of the same thing .

but there &apos;s a lot of technology going .
sort of a timeline , very non-linear scale , nature rates and trilobites and dinosaurs , and eventually we saw some humans with caves ... birds were flying overhead , after pterosaurs .

i take you are preparing a major attack ?
if i may ask , do you pay for school in your country ?
that ’ s really my thinking .

i should warn you , they &apos;re pretty powerful .
they are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and , to some extent , the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job .
but what the blogosphere offers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective , distributive intelligence that is out there , and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of accessing it .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray ,

one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stripy thing : is that a tiger just about to jump out and kill us ?
so , who got more than five circles figured out ?
and he asked them to come along one evening , and to bring a problem with them that they were working on .
and we ’ ve certainly learnt that over time , you get much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes when everybody does play by the rules .
they were meeting with them ; they were talking to the surgeons about what it was they needed with this device .
so we do quite a lot of work at ideo trying to convince our clients of this .
so anyhow , he went there with his video camera , and it ’ s kind of interesting to see what he brought back .
but everybody agreed to play a game where the worst sketch artist bought the next round of drinks .

but we ’ re all disciplined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether i ’ m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
so this is the foundations of what ’ s called , traditionally , liberal political theory and newtonian physics .
there must be mechanisms of self-organization inside the universe that make things .
and you understand some things better than other things ,
and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists .
and one that looks destined , in fact , to be permanent .
it will refer you directly to your congressperson , to your u.s. senator , to your governor where divestment legislation is pending .
so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century , and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here , as we speak .
they &apos;re in some ways using the bush administration as an alibi .
he moved with the headlines .
i &apos;m sergio , i &apos;m a humanitarian , and i want to feed those --
well , if you denounce , you &apos;re probably never going to get back in the room .
which is how i would have framed the question .
whether it &apos;s nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev .
how sisyphean this task was of mending ,
and now i really like sort of sitting up , you know .
whether they &apos;re kind of glorified in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , ironically glorified , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of denigrated , or ironically denigrated . i go back to color all the time .
so in editing these clips , i didn &apos;t have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe &apos;s pub .
i always say to my partner , marisa gardini , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .

i forgot that i said that . but it &apos;s really true .
im : churns ?
so , that &apos;s what we call our first five employees during the tea break , you know , in here .
it &apos;s not very appropriate to do it now . some people tell me to do it ;
well , the way i think about it is fairly simple .
and if you look at the height of it and you compare it to mount everest , you see , it &apos;ll give you an idea of how large that mount olympus , you know , is , relative to mount everest .
well , here we are four years later , and they &apos;re still working .
it looks like i could have told you these are pictures taken from the sahara desert or somewhere , and you &apos;d have believed me , but these are pictures taken from mars .
rg : the temperature of the heat shield can reach 2,600 degrees fahrenheit .
bc : edl is this immense , technically challenging problem .
we are coming at extremely high speeds , and we are deploying them to slow us down . so we have to do all kinds of tests .
now , &quot; the lord of the rings &quot; has two things played through it .
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have frozen .
i &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
at modern art . then i realized how , you know , the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy .
ja , well i could have translated that , but you would have been none the wiser .
this is jasper johns . we can see here he was practicing with his ruler .
or you could go into three-dimensional art .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : stewart brand works on the clock of the long now , a timepiece that counts down the next 10,000 years . it &apos;s a beautiful project that asks us to think about the far , far future . here , he discusses a tricky side problem with the clock : where can we put it ?
that &apos;s what happens to buildings . they &apos;re vulnerable .
that &apos;s a 2,000-foot thick formation , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
at the end of it there &apos;s something physical , a kind of reward that you take away .
and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the white mountains that were over 4,000 years old .
they don &apos;t quite meet .
you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain .
and it really is hidden . i can &apos;t find it in this image ,
and they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
but from the outside it should be invisible .
it is a story of hope , resilience and glamour .
here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me .
they can afford to watch their &quot; robocop &quot; and whatever .
bernard pinayon agbaosi : we have been so deep into the foreign movies .
woman : that &apos;s why i use enough masking tape .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us .
thank you very much .
and i have to say , this really proves that storytelling , it &apos;s a commodity , it &apos;s a staple .
so there &apos;s a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here .
you hear about mars , it &apos;s a problem communicating to mars because it takes light long enough to go there .
so we have this picture , which is quite a spectacular picture , and i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning .
so there &apos;s an interesting pattern , but we don &apos;t have enough data here to actually see the pattern .
so what i &apos;m going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of scales .
so a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that &apos;s the scale .
that &apos;s the issue , right ?
and at that point , the universe mysteriously starts accelerating its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure .

and we really don &apos;t have experience with pandemics , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gut-level experience with .
and we can &apos;t fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we &apos;re doing , because a million-dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage , causes a trillion dollar response which is largely ineffective and arguably , probably almost certainly , has made the problem worse .
the thing that we see as the kind of moore &apos;s law trend that &apos;s driving improvement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials .
i had one business plan where i was trying to learn more about witten &apos;s cosmic dimension strings to try to understand what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial .
vaccines that are broad spectrum .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost unacceptable to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
ridiculous , right ?

now , look at the guy .
i kind of like asked these questions and chatted with him through a translator in kind of a half whisper .
it really is the garden of eden .
the lupin bush , it &apos;s all around extremadura .
and i &apos;m just saying , &quot; no way . &quot;
i &apos;m really in love with him at this point .
but i said , &quot; now look , you &apos;re in spain , some of the greatest chefs in the world are -- ferran adria , the preeminent chef of the world today , not that far from you .

interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer ’ s disease .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : science writer richard preston talks about some of the most enormous living beings on the planet , the giant trees of the us pacific northwest . growing from a tiny seed , they support vast ecosystems -- and are still , largely , a mystery .
chris , could you extend your arm out that way ? there we go . ok .
but they made it to the top , and what they found was not a redwood desert , but a lost world -- a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air , filled with unknown life .
you do feel a sense of exposure .
this particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base and extends upward for 150 feet .
if a portion of a redwood is rotting , the redwood will send roots into its own form and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart .
one of the things that is just -- i almost can &apos;t conceive it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn &apos;t picked this up at all ,
you can think of the earth &apos;s biosphere as a palace , and the continents are rooms in the palace , and the islands are small rooms .
and if you look at projections over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years , it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.1 billion vehicles .
that hydrogen &apos;s being made because there &apos;s a good business reason for its use .
and the key to all of this is to make it affordable , to make it exciting , to get it on a pathway where there &apos;s a way to make money doing it .
nick sears : demo : the orb
now this piece is currently in process -- due out in may -- but what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve put together a small demo , just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere .

these were just some of the things i &apos;ve made .
in my shop where i studied , or learned , there was a traditional hierarchy of master , journeyman and learned worker , and apprentice , and i worked as the apprentice .
however , the director , the chemist , model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means , with my work -- than making toilets ,
so i was arrested quite early in stalin &apos;s purges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
and most of those losses are because of things we know .
so it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those losses .
you know , they pick up their hives ; they move their families once or twice in a year .
when they &apos;re out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower , they stay to that crop exclusively , in order to help generate .
there are other animals that pollinate , like bats , and bats are in trouble too .
i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns at a limited scale , and i think we &apos;re encouraged to do that .
jay walker : my library of human imagination
but why is this so interesting ? here ’ s the quick story .
so you can see here in the lower level of the library
we get to see a skull . but there it is .
was kip forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
and this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
it tasted fine . it tasted interesting .
it &apos;s fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts .
i switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , &quot; you know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . &quot;
and then i tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways .
now , this is bernoulli &apos;s gift . this is a direct quote .
but in fact , there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place .
when was the last time that you saw extensive interviews with everybody who lost ?
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before i &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?

i have to show you something from my own lab , so let me sneak this in .
and if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks
here &apos;s the second problem : you can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month . which would you prefer ?

thank you .
people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there &apos;s good reason , but sometimes people think there are .
is that what happened ?
now , i think there &apos;s many good reasons not to listen to economists .
and at that time i was working in the antarctic and the arctic , and high deserts and low deserts .
and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate when the viking landers landed on mars .
and those planetary systems are going to be very common .
very critically , how do we protect it , if we find it , and not contaminate it ?
and it is a completely hostile environment for us .
this stuff is produced biologically .
and when they hollow out , then they become habitats for organisms .

you &apos;re used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top .

in colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .

the cuban missile crisis was resolved in a chinese restaurant called yenching palace in washington , dc ,
if you see them side by side , there &apos;s yellow and brown .
it was introduced into the united states in the 1800s , but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s .
i like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke one culture ever played on another , because &quot; chop suey , &quot; translated into chinese , means &quot; jaahp-seui , &quot; which , translated back , means &quot; odds and ends . &quot;
who came up with the idea of chop suey ?
this is something that , in the chinese version , has no soup .
this is a slip one of the winners had ,
i was surprised to discover that not only in philadelphia , but also in atlanta .
it was called -- it was called &quot; the air pump , &quot; or something like &quot; the leviathan and the air pump . &quot;
they didn &apos;t call it a vacuum pump at the time .
come here and you can meet in the building , but just don &apos;t talk about religion in there .
i mean , reality is what you can see .

i may not care about the fact that it &apos;s prohibited from heating this solution .
there &apos;s a lot of little things involved in making a rocket that it will actually work , even after you have the fuel .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
there is nothing in their contract , in fact , that makes it to their advantage always , to tell you the truth .
which would be evidence for strengthening of the tropical circulation in the 1990s .

i made a desktop publishing system way back when , and that was , kind of , my first step into figuring out how to -- oh , these two sides are kind of fun to mix .
i built a working version of an adobe illustrator-ish thing .
and so began to have multiple pens on the page -- again , hard to do with our hands .

dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it .
this is sort of a nice helicopter ride through those early beds ,
there &apos;s no roads into the sahara . it &apos;s an enormous place .
and , you know , on and on -- a whole menagerie . when you pick up something like this -- and some of you have had the chance to touch it -- this is a piece of history . you &apos;re touching something that &apos;s 110 million years old .
we had to try and reconstruct this .
ps : don &apos;t get off ! don &apos;t get off ! don &apos;t get off !
we can &apos;t predict , necessarily , what will happen in evolution , but we can learn some of the rules of the game ,
and run it a thousand times , so we can estimate the parameters , to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not , at least to know the barriers of the problems . so that &apos;s a little bit about the science .
we &apos;ve known that for a long time . we &apos;ve gone through the sputnik phase , and now , as you see the increase in the pace of what we &apos;re doing , it becomes even more prominent . where are all these people going to come from ?
it &apos;s hard to get them to envision themselves as a scientist ,
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in italy .
i walk to work every day or ride my scooter , and i come down and park in this little spot .
and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry .
he got a job working for raytheon , designing guidance systems , which was part of the route 128 high-tech axis in those days -- so the equivalent of silicone valley in the &apos; 70s .
vision based on what one cannot see : the vision of that unseen and unknowable .
and if you move to the right you also get language , because that &apos;s abstracting even further from resemblance , but still maintaining meaning .
there were hypertext comics .
here &apos;s another one i &apos;ll show you . this is by drew weing ; this is called , &quot; pup contemplates the heat death of the universe . &quot; see what &apos;s going on here
and let &apos;s face it , everyone &apos;s trying to move towards whole grains .
and so , if we can release some of those , they become accessible to us in our palate .
it &apos;s yeast burps and sweat .
when it gets to about 160 degrees , the proteins all line up and they create structure , the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread .
it &apos;s just a euphemism for killing , right ?
and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call &quot; leaven . &quot; in this case , it &apos;s yeast , but yeast is leaven . what does leaven mean ?
the yeast , whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough , to enliven it , to vivify it ,
i like dark spent grain . today we &apos;re using a light spent grain
commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy that lasted for millennia .
think about meaningful places .
right ? all of those are man-made , artificiality brought into the woods by you , and by the very nature of being there .
and all those things make something inauthentic .
if you do like it , it &apos;s faux .
knowing where your heritage is : what you have done in the past .
right ? coffee , at its core , is what ?
and that moved us to the next level .
it is the program . it is the code of life .
we are starting to understand that .
you will give your genome to the pharmacist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were --
an architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox ,
so , don &apos;t worry about , don &apos;t stress about that stuff . we &apos;ve been doing this forever .
there are thousands of microbes there .
so , carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar , not anything .
the scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad , but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so .
and actually , a growing number of science publishers are adopting this model .
now , just to be clear , in this talk i &apos;m using the name &quot; earth witness &quot; as part of the scenario , simply as a shorthand , for what this imaginary project could aspire to ,
it &apos;s hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone carried by a person .
so why have i spent the bulk of my time telling you about something that doesn &apos;t exist ?
so , in 2000 we wrote &quot; rare earth . &quot; in 2003 , we then asked , let &apos;s not think about where earths are in space , but how long has earth been earth ?
well , we know from astrobiology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
the effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful ammonites , leconteiceras here , and celaeceras over here , and so much else .
that &apos;s an 18-inch long skull of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet , sprawled like a lizard , probably had a head like a lion .
they hate we animals .
this is when deep-earth material comes to the surface , spreads out over the surface of the planet .
well now , i die .
do we all have to have a little button saying , let me die ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
they all come down to the idea of an expectation of something good that is due to happen .
i &apos;m intrigued by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19th century -- actually , in the second decade of the 19th century -- by a 27-year-old poet whose name was percy shelley .
and who no doubt will continue to succeed , as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause .
i call this hypersonic sound .
what if i could aim sound the way i aim light ?
and , you know , if the sound isn &apos;t there , the sale typically isn &apos;t made .
well , if i turn up the amplitude too much , i &apos;m having an effect on the pressure , which means during the making of that sine wave , the speed at which it is propagating is shifting .
i &apos;m serious . and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance , from 100 yards away when they play this thing .
you &apos;ve been a great audience . i know i &apos;ve jumped all over the place .
so , why don &apos;t you tell that story ?
&quot; i want to see if i can , you know -- i need to just see if i can sit in on some of your practices , see what drills you do and whatever . &quot;
and i , i mean , was just mortified -- because i was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour .
i made the front page of my hometown paper that i delivered for six years , you know ?
so they call us out and , you know -- &quot; ladies , you have one minute . &quot;
there are hair follicles on them , and i can paint my toenails .
but without having the silicon sock , i &apos;m just going to try slip in it .
and it &apos;s really an amazing store . i got them a year and two weeks ago . and this is just a silicon piece of skin .

these sequences right up here -- which don &apos;t even code for protein , by the way -- are almost absolutely identical across all of these ,
and so we can look at spots .
we don &apos;t know what the sequence is ; just pull them out of the field .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
well , first of all , when you have a big chip like this , you need a little bit more informatics ,
switch antibiotics : so they switched to another antibiotic , tamiflu . it &apos;s not clear why they thought she had the flu , but they switched to tamiflu .

you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a pure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at guessing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mutations -- and you use natural selection to kill off not as good solutions .
now that we have concentrated sunlight , what are we going to put at the center to convert sunlight to electricity ?
the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn &apos;t matter so much if your energy source is free .
we got the results from that for the optimal engine .
you don &apos;t have to tell what orientation .
it turns out there &apos;s a lot of powerful sun all around the world , obviously , but in special places where it happens to be relatively inexpensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power .
so there &apos;s basically 15 horses running at full speed just to keep the stage lit .
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
there &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
we need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things .
because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
now , there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made .
even a teacher who wants to improve doesn &apos;t have the tools to do it .
but i -- i &apos;m optimistic .
once i realized that i could take some liberties with the subject , i did the following series of drawings .
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts , where i teach ,
and i was going to do a thing , i say , &quot; well , change the copy . let it say something about dreams , and come to sva and you &apos;ll sort of fulfill your dreams . &quot;
this could be embarrassing .
so i worked very hard on this .

evan williams : the voices of twitter users
among the other interesting things that have cropped up are many things from businesses , from marketing and communications and predictable things , to an insanely popular korean-barbecue taco truck that drives around l.a. and twitters where it stops , causing a line to form around the block .
this not only lets you view twitters in different ways , but it introduces new use cases as well .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any other way of getting instant feedback that way .
so david and i decided to go find out , through the best research we could muster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .

what i really did was i just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know monocultures , but a natural forest is multilayered . that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light , it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more functions . but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
on the top left , underneath those green stripes , you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants that you can see from space .

nalini nadkarni : conserving the canopy
these plants occur in great diversity , over 28,000 species around the world .
i &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives .
he saw nests in the canopy at one of our canopy confluences in the pacific northwest , and created this beautiful sculpture .
well , my thought was that i could learn how to grow mosses , and that way we wouldn &apos;t have to take them out of the wild .

my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and &quot; pretty , &quot; and &quot; emotions . &quot;
yeah ! yeah .
so , imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long and i &apos;m going to walk on it , and you see i can walk on it without looking , i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down .
and when you &apos;re happy -- what we call positive valence -- you squirt dopamine into the prefrontal lobes , which makes you a breadth-first problem solver :
and when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing .
but that &apos;s reflective design as well .
but i would say no .
he can ask for additional information .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; disabled &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
so this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer peter saville , went to fashion designer alexander mcqueen , and photographer nick knight , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
and i can change my height --
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and something very unusual happens .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electroencephalogram , the right brain of each of them becomes attuned , so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes and the physiology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a handle on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an anatomically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
try and imagine a culture or a life , adult or otherwise without play .
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different .
and one of their projects was to see what makes meetings boring , and to try and do something about it .
and this is where my chasing animals for four , five years really changed my perspective from a clinician to what i am now , which is that play has a biological place , just like sleep and dreams do .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : 20 years ago , tim berners-lee invented the world wide web . for his next project , he &apos;s building a web for open , linked data that could do for numbers what the web did for words , pictures , video : unlock our data and reframe the way we use it together .
i can show somebody a piece of hypertext , a page which has got links , and we click on the link and bing -- there &apos;ll be another hypertext page .
who was here or has otherwise seen hans rosling &apos;s talk ?
data is relationships .
this is just the grassroots stuff again , ok ?
audience : raw .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
that &apos;s how linked data works .
i ’ m going around the world giving talks about darwin ,
you have to look in our brains to understand why they ’ re sweet .
it ’ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers .
dan ariely : our buggy moral code
or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
other people i would tempt to cheat .
we call this like a personal fudge factor .
we did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
you call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
and i found lots of reference material , lots of lovely pictures . no dice : no dodo skeleton for me . but the damage had been done .
i actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them .
and so now it was time to do some research .
so i was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure .
like it is in the movie .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
this is popular workbench . popular science magazines in those days -- i had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 30s --
this is tank polo in the south hamptons .
i did that as a quick back page -- i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon , and i did that , and i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m ashamed . i hope nobody knows it . &quot;
people always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ?
we &apos;ve also found that you can reduce the fresh air requirements into the building , while maintaining industry indoor air-quality standards .
40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
so this is of course orville and wilbur wright , and the wright flyer .
so we &apos;re beyond the 12-second steps .
jacqueline novogratz : an escape from poverty
i was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
and so she can &apos;t move out .
it &apos;s an opportunity to truly build a world where we can extend services and products to all human beings , so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .
now , it works just like a regular phone .
and it &apos;s so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it .
this is me with a camcorder on a phone going like this .
right ? nobody knows you &apos;re in pakistan .
like you can say , i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours .
these are all the different things that you can text to google and they will -- yeah ! you &apos;re all trying to write this down .
google : hold on .
that &apos;s who can afford to do that .
there are these services that transcribe your voicemail into text .
so it had better be the gist of the gist , right ?
phone : well , i don &apos;t know if you heard , you might have heard from lenny , but -- i think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iphone .
it &apos;s absurd . we have power outlets in every room of every building . we have running water .
it will immediately play you that song or that band .
sorry , that was mean .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
so during the last 15 years , i &apos;ve been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i &apos;ve labeled &quot; viral chatter , &quot; which was a term coined by my mentor don burke .
the animals are simply gone .
now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder -- this is the individual that hunted the monkey from the last picture that i showed you .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspects of our message , whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation or health prevention .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monitoring , we decided to move this from research , to really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : poet c.k. williams reads his work at ted2001 . as he colors scenes of childhood resentments , college loves , odd neighbors and the literal death of youth , he reminds us of the unique challenges of living .
in those long-ago days , women , my mother , my friends &apos; mothers , our neighbors , all the women i knew -- wore , often much of the day , what were called housedresses , cheap , printed , pulpy , seemingly purposefully shapeless light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown and , when you had to go look for a child , hang wash on the line , or run down to the grocery store on the corner , under a coat ,
and head on my shoulder , hand on my thigh , sang sweetly along , of regrets and depletions she was too young for ,
taking my arm , leaning lightly against me . her wavering step into the world .
a social , ethical rage and rebellion -- despair too , though , grief , loss .
weightfully upon me was the world .
what carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
and design is responsible for this experience .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
i started with paragliding .
base jumping is skydiving from fixed objects , like buildings , antennae , bridges and earth -- meaning mountains , cliffs .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
that &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
and there it is , that &apos;s the bambi 16 .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is battlefield reality already .
like the invention of the atomic bomb .
first is , you &apos;re going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments ,
an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site . missile hits , bodies burst into the air with the explosion .
and then you get in the car and you drive home and within 20 minutes , you &apos;re sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their homework . &quot;
we &apos;ve already had three instances of predator drone strikes where we thought we got bin laden , and it turned out not to be the case .
and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil , but for me it points to the fact that there &apos;s a duality of humans as well .
it &apos;s not the way they occur in the film ,
richard saul wurman : i remember hearing him talk at penn .
nk : yeah . no not louis farrakhan , louis kahn .
but i think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that &apos;s why , he has given love for us .
i engage in the use of game theory , game theory is a branch of mathematics and that means , sorry , that even in the study of politics , math has come into the picture .
if we &apos;re talking about national security problems , maybe it &apos;s the secretary of state , maybe it &apos;s the secretary of defense , the director of national intelligence , maybe the ambassador to the united nations , or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem .
they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .
i remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate .
it would achieve some national pride , but not go ahead and build a weapon .
two things to notice : he &apos;s getting weaker , and while he gets a lot of attention in the united states , he is not a major player in iran .
bbm : well , people of iran , this is what many of you are going to evolve to want , and we could get there a lot sooner , and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions ,
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it .
but the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
once we got that far , we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
so , we &apos;ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
i thought narcissism meant you loved yourself .
so you &apos;re six years old , you &apos;re reading snow white and the seven dwarves , and it becomes rapidly obvious that there are only two kinds of men in the world : dwarves and prince charmings .
that &apos;s the other way that humor -- like art buchwald takes shots at the heads of state .
i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial .
&quot; for sale : white trash compactor . &quot; so this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way .
and it was like being psychoanalyzed .
so that &apos;s one -- this boundary crossing , this go-between which -- fritz lanting , is that his name ,
i love connections .
and the daughter says , as tactfully as possible , &quot; mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ? &quot;
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
or what we call the &quot; sweet gravy , stop me before i kill again ! &quot;
ted talk subtitles and transcript : forget about the hybrid auto -- shai agassi says it &apos;s electric cars or bust if we want to impact emissions . his company , better place , has a radical plan to take entire countries oil-free by 2020 .
how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
and you can go again .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars -- that &apos;s what we needed in israel --
if you fail the iq test they ask you to leave the country .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world .
we forgot about the entire chain around us .
we have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
we have to make the right moral decision .
we &apos;re biological creatures .
well , it will really mean precious little .
but in five to ten years we &apos;re going to start see some very profound changes .
it would change absolutely everything .
and pretty soon it &apos;s going to be possible to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way .
that &apos;s really the central one , i believe .
and that &apos;s where about half of our drugs come .
and what &apos;s extraordinary is that we &apos;re not just observing this , we are the architects of this .
imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material .
these generative algorithms grow over time , and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects .
as the sound starts to pulse and contract , our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted .
and this routine went on for some time .
and that &apos;s what i want everyone in here to feel like , the incredible hulk , at the end of this presentation .
the problem is hydrodynamics .
below is what most swimmers will find enables them to do what i did , which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length to 11 strokes in two workouts with no coach , no video monitoring .
so , but i didn &apos;t say . i said , . pretty close .
and have continued to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now .
she comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
these seemed to be the three areas that i could exploit to compete if i wanted to comptete against people who &apos;d been practicing for 20 to 30 years .
so fear is your friend . fear is an indicator .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : in this talk from ted university 2009 , veteran rock climber matthew childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing . these handy tips bear on an effective life at sea level , too .
but you also can &apos;t forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete .
so balance is really critical , and keeping your weight on your feet , which is your strongest muscle .
that installation there is about six feet across ,
global warming . and we &apos;ve got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure .
so here we have a line and a point outside the line .
does anyone want to guess what it is ?
and you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces .
taken on this inner organic life of its own .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
so that it was something that just got into your spirit .
studied painting ; didn &apos;t do very well at that .
and i flew it .
so he said , &quot; well i &apos;ll come over and look at it . &quot;
would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone ?
and there is a variety of other things : the shape of the cushions , the gel we put .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
in louisiana , about one in five white voters said , &quot; yes , one of the big reasons why i voted against barack obama is because he was an african-american . &quot;
so yes , racism is predictable .
and likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , &quot; would you not vote for a qualified black president ? &quot;
but the point is , this is all good news ,
and so there is a team of developers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from malawi , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information overload .
these are , most of these are from a monthly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called metropolis .
adults find it comforting .
that &apos;s the end .
the profound convolutions on the surface of a dried cherry .
and they threw up walls -- political walls , trade walls , transportation walls , communication walls , iron curtains -- which divided peoples and nations .
incomes at that time less than $ 1,000 per year .
this provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before .
so the market for those movies is larger .
now we &apos;re not there yet .
twentieth century : a little bit over two percent .
when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 140 per barrel .

by this age the brain can actually store .
and we try to track the changes that occur as the new skill or ability is acquired .
i can raise an animal under conditions that would be equivalent to raising a baby under a moderately loud ceiling fan , in the presence of continuous noise .
it &apos;s a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained in a task that involves it manipulating a tool
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics which represents input from the skin of the fingertips that are engaged .
it &apos;s what &apos;s rewarding to you .
and i &apos;m going to talk about experiments that involve actually using this brain science ,
it &apos;s muffled english . it &apos;s degraded japanese .
changing it in detail . it takes about 30 hours on the average .
just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning , it &apos;s going back into chaos in the end .
of course a lot of people will ignore this advice .
at the end of last christmas only 13 countries had seen h5n1 .
how do you get them mobilized around the world if you &apos;ve shut all the airports down ?
exercises , drills , all over the world .
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pets be kept indoors ?
do we need n95 ? a state-of-the-art , top-of-the-line , must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask ?
every city , county , state did their own thing .
how many masks do you need ?
it &apos;s a very complicated ecology .
audience member : in the 1918 flu i understand that they theorized that there was some attenuation of the virus when it made the leap into humans .
the whole immune system swarms into the lungs .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
why should a conflict like iraq have this as its fundamental signature ?
so we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation ,
they &apos;re more robust ; there is less groups ;

frantz fanon , who was a psychiatrist from martinique , said , &quot; each generation must , out of relative obscurity , discover its mission , and fulfill or betray it . &quot;
we thought everyone could participate .
and folks asked me , &quot; why did you take up what you took up ? &quot;
human creativity . it &apos;s our attempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe , the world around us .
and folks say we need to choose either or .
another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that supports the sciences
to tell you really quickly what i &apos;m doing .
has potential energy , but nothing will happen to it , it can &apos;t do any work until i drop it and it changes states .
the bronze is nice hard , durable material that could roll on the ground .
this is in a sculpture park in taejon .
it was a diamond cell structure was the point of departure .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different iterations .
but then one could interact with that and show plate tectonics or global warming issues , or migrations -- all of the things that we &apos;re concerned with today .
so i &apos;m going to bake bread for you .
it was a mythical past .
and the world population in the meantime has doubled .
and also a source of modernity , of modern life .
we relegate them to poverty .
so what can we do ?
there are different ways in which we must use it -- for residential , for nature , for agriculture purposes .
and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
we try to make big , permanent , important change .
running no deficit , completely supported by the community .
because he &apos;s got an efficient enough factory .
what we &apos;ve done as spammers is tried to hypnotize everyone into buying our idea ,
people i know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon .
it &apos;s easy to look at what i &apos;ve said so far , and say , &quot; wait a minute , i don &apos;t have what it takes to be that kind of leader . &quot;
hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
michelle kaufman has pioneered new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
you don &apos;t need permission from people to lead them .
so i &apos;d like you to do something for me .
now , what has happened ?
so there &apos;s some problem with these metrics now .
and there &apos;s good studies of the refugees coming out of congo -- they have two , three percent infected , and peaceful zambia -- much higher .
look , the highly infected are four percent of all population
vodka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
♫ we &apos;re ready to fly ! ♫ thank you very much .
now in india &apos;s case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .
the third big thing i believe that has changed india is our attitude towards the english language .
and therefore democracy has become embedded .
but today , finally , after economic reforms , and economic growth , i think the notion that cities are engines of economic growth , cities are engines of creativity , cities are engines of innovation , have finally been accepted .
it &apos;s very difficult to start a private university .
number one , this matters because this represents more than a billion people .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest culprit in this massive mistreatment of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
in a landfill or an incinerator --
thinking it through , i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator .
we call it cool carpet .
what else is there ?
and now the challenge is in execution .
and through his sobering point of view i saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
and i came up with an idea that i would write a cookbook .
i will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior , and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality .
if i cover the rest of the cube , you can see that they are identical .
and countries on the left that seem to giving very little , or much less .
we wake up in the morning and we open the closet ; we feel that we decide what to wear .
and they took a group of physicians . they presented to them a case study of a patient .
but the moment you set this as the default , it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing .
and they passed me from one person to another to another ,
if we &apos;re attracted or not .
in fact , in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
so it would have been moving images .
and she said , &quot; yeah , but you know i &apos;d rather finish my meal if you don &apos;t mind . &quot;
you know ? you can get cadavers if you work at a university . &quot;
and apparently the royal court physician said to her , &quot; i am of the opinion that the vulva of your most sacred majesty be titillated for some time prior to intercourse . &quot;
sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop abnormalities that make them less effective at head-banging their way into the egg .
okay . when i was in denmark , my host was named anne marie .
this did not stop masters and johnson .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
so we are very encouraged by these results .
also the u.s. and japan .
joachim de posada : don &apos;t eat the marshmallow !
and they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful .
and this applies for everything . even in sales .
hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium .
two billion of them .
your native language is your life .
can you believe that ?
i was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life :
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
i never cut class . sorry , i don &apos;t know if anybody is cutting class .
and i hope in pursuing your dreams , you all remain resolute , that you go forward without limits , and that you use your talents -- because there are many ; we &apos;ve seen them ;
and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us .
and then they go away and plan exactly how they &apos;re going to collect these seeds . they have thousands of people all over the world tagging places where those plants are said to exist . they search for them . they find them in flower .
these are not just crop plants , as you might have seen stored in svalbard in norway --
kaki king : playing &quot; pink noise &quot; on guitar
the story begins in the late &apos; 90s .
as one moves up the ladder , values other than technical competence are viewed with increasing suspicion .
mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy eludes vast numbers of our students .
the challenge : to figure out what it will take to actually do something that makes a significant and sustainable difference .
this discovery is transforming .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
and that really describes information technology .
i mean this went through thick and thin , through war and peace , through boom times and recessions .
the amount of dna data we &apos;ve sequenced has doubled every year .
and we &apos;re only eight doublings away from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs .
then we are going to apply them to the other areas , like energy , ecology , policy law and ethics , entrepreneurship , so that people can bring these new technologies to the world .
in alberta people work nonstop , 24 hours by seven to extract as much oil as they can .
the beautiful picture , by &#91; unclear &#93; in africa .
fourth man : i live happily because what else should i do ?
and i think that comes from connecting with nature , connecting with the energy of life ,
and have conquered the whole planet .
so what are we waiting for ?
this was my mental model of the world :
but i think we &apos;re in for another change ,
and when you look at the worldwide sources of co2 , 52 percent are tied to buildings .
and they are so excited . that &apos;s the first board off the line .
last but not least , bill gates , i know you invented windows .
so we considered all of this . and we realized that electrical appliances must be able to communicate directly with the power receptacle itself .
thank you .
although the rates of happiness are about as flat as the surface of the moon , depression and anxiety are rising .
it destroys hippocampal cells and memory , and can lead to all kinds of health problems .
and then three emotions for which there are no english words : fiero , which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge ; schadenfreude , which is happiness in another &apos;s misfortune , a malicious pleasure ; and naches , which is a pride and joy in one &apos;s children .
it wouldn &apos;t do anything but press this bar .
and if you stick your tongue out at this baby , the baby will do the same .
we are very acutely aware of our social status and always seek to further and increase it .
they went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control to generosity and forgiveness .
these are gecko toes .
now the problem with the robots doing this is that they can &apos;t get unstuck , with the material .
and it was unstable without its tail .
the engineers had a really good idea .
and it works just like it does in the animal .
it &apos;s unbelievable .

back in the mid- &apos; 80s when we were designing biosphere 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
so , on the top , we had these beautiful rainforests and an ocean ,
we were taking their biomass , storing them in the basement , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
yes . in a sense it was terrifying .
and i recoiled . they stank !
which is going to be pretty fun .

slow , text-based conversations ,
this thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
last may , china in the sichuan province
even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens ,
and so they started , the citizen journalists started
it comes in relatively sparse chunks ,
they also affect people who want to send messages ,
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals ,
on american persons .
but not to control their supporters .

and how i &apos;ve come to view what happened to me is a viral , memetic infection .
and so the first step is to realize that we can do this together , and that there is no &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
he &apos;s got some seizure disorder . and you don &apos;t understand this .
and so here you see him doing a lithotomy .
you could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gut , on the liver , on the heart , on the brain .
surgeons had to give up their 3d vision .
so , smartypants , why isn &apos;t all surgery being done this way ? &quot;
or , not so coincidentally , like a tube like this .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
and the prospect i &apos;m offering you , of an easier surgery ...
&quot; one bite , adam . don &apos;t abandon eve . &quot;
and the problem is that they can become biased ,
developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
so i want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
that will produce a legitimate and accountable government .
so that is what you get when you face reality .
one is it &apos;s got to do economic reform , not fuss about the political constitution .
typical post-conflict situation is a zoo of different actors with different priorities .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
so we need to encourage the growth of local firms .
they would be co-branded as being done by the post-conflict government , in the country .
because there wouldn &apos;t be any money in taking part in the politics .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and participating in it .
and this challenges yet another assumption ,
not out of the question --
and that &apos;s where my imagined future comes in ,
what is the story you most want for them to tell ?
because the south pole is at 10,000 feet ,
where do you sleep ? we slept in a tent that was very low to the ground ,
can you imagine ? seriously , can you imagine ?
on the other hand , statistics -- that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
we &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
and the things that they build amaze even themselves .
there is a picture of charles . so let &apos;s watch the next clip .
i think one of the things i am passionate about , my grandparents work ,
but you know the object is just a pivot .
the house is 1949 .
e.o. wilson once told me that when he looked at ants -- he loved them , of course , and he wanted to learn more about them -- he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale .
dawn , very good . also rode on one . i ... audience : you had , i hope you had -- ed : now you &apos;ve been to the website dogs of saint louis in the late , in the mid-1930 &apos;s , then you &apos;d know that was a great dane .
we had the spelling bee in conjunction with the gwomeus club .
so my point is that this scope of vision , this holistic vision of design , was with them from the beginning .
and i really think that &apos;s where we are .
so this year we &apos;re going to visualize how the brain visualizes .
so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways .
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
&lt; speaker &gt; sophal ear &lt; / speaker &gt;
the khmer rouge didn &apos;t believe in money .
and it wasn &apos;t until she met a vietnamese lady who told her this , and then tutored her for two days intensively , that she was able to go into her exam
&lt; speaker &gt; kary mullis &lt; / speaker &gt;
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
you &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line --
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent , per capita . and we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state .
they are poor , but they are intensely urban . and they are intensely creative .
and you go to a nice dense place like this slum in mumbai .
so one thing slammed up against another , such as in sao paulo here .
very interesting side effect here ,
so with hydro maxed out ,
these things are way smaller . they &apos;re much more adaptable .
and biotech is moving rapidly in africa , at last .
here is an example that climatologists like a lot ,
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
with such a big space , the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace , and what the space , in that sense , is .
it was really about showing people , in this city , as they walk by , that space has dimensions . a space has time .
if you stand still , the landscape doesn &apos;t necessarily tell you how big it is .
what does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
and bone marrow is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma and some other diseases .
we can do multiple passes through that same entry .
it may even enable you to bank your own marrow stem cells , when you &apos;re younger and healthier , to use in the future should you need it .
and what came up was a number of pieces of data .
but if you have this gene , in utero your brain is bathed in this ,
and here is this &quot; killed strangely , &quot; and it &apos;s this historical book .

and it was quite curious . he said , &quot; of all the differences between the races of men , the color of the skin is the most conspicuous
but uvb and uva especially , came in unimpeded .
and , significantly , that uva has no ability to make vitamin d in your skin .
what they haven &apos;t been so good about instructing people is the problem of darkly pigmented people living in high latitude areas , or working inside all the time .
when people ask you , &quot; what is the evidence for evolution ? &quot;
ted talk subtitles and transcript : we &apos;re at a unique moment in history , says uk prime minister gordon brown : we can use today &apos;s interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty , security , climate change and the economy .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
and nelson mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and i was explaining to him at the time who she was .
i have just been talking to the president of sierra leone .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world .
one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs .
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
there &apos;s a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything , and the existence of low self-esteem .
this idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to ,
if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve messed up their lives .
it would be insane to call hamlet a loser .
but as i get older , i &apos;m also very nuanced about what that word &quot; success &quot; might mean .
let &apos;s make sure our ideas of success are truly our own .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
so i write software . and that &apos;s how i do it .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light . and as you do , you see the shadows of your own speech .
it &apos;s a really profound amount of nonverbal information that &apos;s communicated with the eyes .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
that &apos;s why its other name is doubletaker , taker of doubles .
and all over the world , eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this .
but then , in the &apos; 90s , something began to unravel .
he said what scientists do when a paradigm fails is , guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened .
you must never do that again . &quot;
and take bipedality .
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath .
everybody i talk to says it &apos;s rubbish .
darwin &apos;s ideas and mendel &apos;s ideas blending together .
but you know , that makes me feel good ,
what kinds of rules ?
now , you won &apos;t be surprised to learn that the rules in north korea keep people there in the dark .
growth took off in china . the chinese started catching up very quickly with the united states .
so the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city .
the thing that was bad about colonialism , and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension .
perhaps even in some arrangement that &apos;s a little bit like an escrow account , where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it .
how would we finance this ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : willard wigan tells the story of how a difficult and lonely childhood drove him to discover his unique ability -- to create art so tiny that it can &apos;t be seen with the naked eye . his slideshow of figures , as seen through a microscope , can only be described as mind-boggling .
so i told her .
it became part of me .
so i got the teddy bear and i said , &quot; do you mind if i pull out one of your fibers ? &quot;
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; mr. huf isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot;
and put it underneath the microscope .
so what i decided to do is to pluck fine hair out of my face .
and what i normally do is walk &apos; round a room -- -- trying to find one . and then i put it underneath the microscope .
i used a microscopic shard of diamond to actually carve the actual base .
and that &apos;s 24-karat gold . and it &apos;s constructed . i built it .
what if it was from a source like this ?
however , after a few failed prototypes , i finally came up with this , the lifesaver bottle .
so we &apos;re just going to put that in there as well .
so let &apos;s look at the applications .
about half a cent a day to run .
this is what i would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again .
and like , knock like a woodpecker on my door until i opened it up .
so the engineer &apos;s boss said , &quot; find a way to quiet this train . &quot;
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink ,
it &apos;s actually a company a company that i &apos;m involved in called onesun ,
we use five polymers in the natural world to do everything that you see .
you know we use pvc , and we sheath wires with pvc for insulation .
one of the big ideas , one of the big projects i &apos;ve been honored to work on is a new website . and i would encourage you all to please go to it .
and also , the easiest one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
i wanted to revenge for my village .
i knew it was rude , but we needed food .
your empty bellies on the telly and now it &apos;s you that i &apos;m fighting for .
i hated the people in the north .
somebody donated 20 cents online .
that &apos;s what i want to do to change , to make a difference in the world .
♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ? ♫ ♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ another starving refugee ♫ ♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ if emma never rescued me ? ♫ ♫ yeah , yeah ♫ ♫ yeah , i would have probably died from starvation ♫ ♫ or some other wretched disease ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refugee ♫
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this .
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to establish norms , averages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;
i spent the last couple of years
in western europe , in many parts of asia , in north america , in australia , white-collar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work .
they gave these mit students a bunch of games ,
alma mater of eleven nobel laureates in economics .
but if you want engagement , self-direction works better .
radical amounts of autonomy .
just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an economist , anywhere , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia . if they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
they thought , &quot; who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot;
the most expensive grid power in the world is thousandths of that .
number one question i get asked .
credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
because remember dr. soljacic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cellphone beeping .
so i think in closing , sort of in the immortal visions of the new yorker magazine , i thought i &apos;d put up one more slide .
and here you have the dataset .
look here when i move them forward .
here we come . and that was the influenza .
whereas china could get healthy much earlier ,
this is east asia , and the light blue there is south asia .
and you have huge differences within countries also .
this is very serious .
the united states has not been so eager to use mdg 4 .
they are moving to cities , where they also get better assistance for that .
the size of the bubbles is how many are hiv affected .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
and we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world .
theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination .
the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery .
i know theater can improve the quality of people &apos;s lives , and i know theater can heal .
we teach , touch and move .
you don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
the good news is a third of you didn &apos;t hold up your hand . your apple &apos;s still out there .
with a number of scientists -- particularly at stanford and university of washington -- to ask the question : what &apos;s going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this ?
disasters have happened . in recent years we lost the gene bank , the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan . you can guess why .
and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd , but ...
and if crops don &apos;t adapt to climate change , neither will agriculture , neither will we .
could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses , or you &apos;ve had laser refractive surgery ?
now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .

and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities .
i have 60,000 of these things in my garden .
elder care , child care , already much bigger employers than cars .
and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation ,
but interestingly too , it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism about how you embed the dna of restless continual innovation into society , trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work .

well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool .
but consider for a moment that sound does have form .
i &apos;m a stunt coordinator . and as well as perform stunts i often design them .
the fire suits of old , the bulky suits , the thick woolen suits , have been replaced with modern materials like nomex or , more recently , carbonex --
they did it by remote control .
that &apos;s the only reason we do it . see , it &apos;s all fun , this job .
which brings us quite nicely to why i &apos;m really here today : project space jump .
above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet , you need pressure breathing , which is where you &apos;re wearing a g suit .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the faa , the caa might say , &quot; you need to put someone in a suit that &apos;s not inflated , that &apos;s connected to the aircraft . &quot;
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 628 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
they &apos;re photographable . they &apos;re measurable .
i personally obsessed about every nut , bolt and washer in these crazy things .
you can see that from the orange line and the blue line .
the calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off , but in fact , it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet .
and you see where it ended in these various spring days , june , may , then october .
you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this , but the camera records it .
it now goes at 125 feet a day , dumping all this ice into the ocean .
this is a terrific , terrific call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .
and so ever since i think i was just six years old , i dreamed of going to the polar regions .
i assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
and they were swollen so much , i couldn &apos;t even close them .
i so believe in you lewis . i &apos;ve seen the way you &apos;ve been training . and i realize the reason why you &apos;re going to do this .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extinct .
those flags represented the countries from which my team came from .
that is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convincing robot .
this is a picture of it .
and now , here comes the other pirate .
and he takes this one .
child : no , because the wind should get in trouble .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
when you hear clicks , we &apos;re turning the machine on .
rs : i &apos;m not .
and we don &apos;t know yet what the implications will be of understanding it .
now organized crime has been around for a very long time , i hear you say ,
and they were the great celebrities of communism ,
but also , as they say in the retail trade , it &apos;s location , location , location .
the congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons ,
and boy , did that make it easy for the money launderers .
there has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .
the key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering .
there is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st century .
he triggered the modernist revolution .
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as a scandinavian version of the spanish steps in rome ,
so the people &apos;s building , as we called it .
so that means that all 1.3 billion chinese have grown up with &quot; the emperor &apos;s new clothes , &quot; &quot; the matchstick girl &quot; and &quot; the little mermaid . &quot;
sort of continuing the public realm into the water .
they tried to pass a law against moving the mermaid .
and essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space underneath the apartments .
you always have to sort of adapt and improvise to the opportunities and accidents that happen , and the sort of turmoil of the world .
and all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater is filtered organically into the landscape , gradually transforming the desert island into sort of a green , lush landscape .
we can see matter . but we can &apos;t see what &apos;s the matter .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful .
and you can &apos;t see the past , except in your memory .
but well done , him .
you can &apos;t see a point . it &apos;s by definition dimensionless , like an electron , oddly enough .
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me .

kermit the frog means nothing to me . &quot;

but in fact people say , &quot; i don &apos;t recognize the people . i can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;

they had one great limitation and one great freedom as they tried to conceive of a global network .
it &apos;s just part of your neighborly duty .
you see , that announcement went one click out , which got reverberated , one click out .
if a man named jimbo came up to you in 2001 and said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a great idea ! we start with seven articles that anybody can edit anything , at any time , and we &apos;ll get a great encyclopedia ! eh ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what keeps wikipedia afloat .
and to this day , the page for star wars kid has a warning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page .
i believe we can build architectures online to make such human requests that much easier to do , to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encounter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and endeavor and impact , and to be able to have an ethical moment where we decide how we want to treat it .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
so this is when i ran out of my idealism and decided to quit my ngo job and actually study how the internet could impede democratization .
the combination of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
this is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation ,
but if you look close enough , you &apos;ll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually operational .
well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of ipods per capita and start thinking about ways in which we can empower intellectuals , dissidents , ngos and then the members of civil society .
we have seven children in my family . all sisters , excepting me .
pump water meant irrigation , a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
&lt; speaker &gt; taryn simon &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america ,
i do take certain liberties and intervene .
this is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into america are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine , where they are tested for diseases including exotic newcastle disease and avian influenza .
and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .

the victim failed to identify larry in two live lineups
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 644 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and the problem is that neither side is listening to the other .
i want to share one story about an innovation called drip irrigation .
and so we needed grants . and he used significant grants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innovate and try again .
whether it &apos;s by finding those innovations that can access the capital markets , government itself , or partner with major corporations , there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation .
and we drove for eight hours along this moonscape-like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were exhausted .
i can only talk from my own experience , but in eight years of running acumen fund , i &apos;ve seen the power of patient capital .
for you this would be a more appropriate map .
today we have 200 countries in the world .
but in fact , with global warming and rising temperatures , all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields and agribusiness , and grain being produced in siberia .
these are the filters and funnels of global capital .
if you add it all up what do you get ?
i don &apos;t believe we should .
if we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map , infrastructure , that cross the straight lines , the borders , i believe the middle east would be a far more peaceful region .
the great game connotes dominance of one over the other .
so in other words , i believe that president sarkozy of france is right when he talks about a mediterranean union .
who will win ? canada ? russia ? the united states ?
something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire .
what makes technology useful and usable ?
so if human need is the place to start , and prototyping , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the destination .
but , again , we are in the midst of massive change .
so that &apos;s one thing that we &apos;ve been working on .
discover what it is that gives you pain
and we need to revive that spirit .
because we can change the world , we have the ability .
garik israelian : how spectroscopy could reveal alien life
and actually it &apos;s amazing , because i got phone calls from many reporters asking , &quot; have you actually seen the planet going into a star ? &quot;
in the core , we have thermonuclear reactions going on ,
i knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy .
and doing this for 14 billion years , we end up with this picture ,
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are tectonically dead ,
you can actually go and detect and study a chemical composition of planets far , far , far from solar system .
in about five years we will discover planets like earth , around sun-like stars , the same distance as the earth from the sun .
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
i arrived there in september 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away .
i think it took me four years to finally read it , while on sabbatical .
sending mail to japanese design magazines and things like that .
that &apos;s connected to a scanner .
there must be something else .
so after eight hours that &apos;s pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .
&lt; speaker &gt; carolyn steel &lt; / speaker &gt;
although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
and in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
cities used to be constrained by geography ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means .
500 years ago it &apos;s what thomas more was asking himself .
this is where food should be in our society .
we need to be thinking more about permaculture ,
what we &apos;re really here to talk about is the &quot; how . &quot;
all of you are members of tribes .
and i want to make the point that as members of society , we need to .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , &quot; what do you think they value ? &quot;
and people came together focused only on those two values : truth and reconciliation .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; we have a dream . &quot; he said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
i don &apos;t know anybody .
and they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
i grew up on a university campus in eastern nigeria .
now , i loved those american and british books i read .
she asked where i had learned to speak english so well , and was confused when i said that nigeria happened to have english as its official language .
now , i &apos;ve laughed every time i &apos;ve read this .
and then , i was overwhelmed with shame .
my cousin polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don &apos;t read literature .
and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don &apos;t have anything in their libraries , and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , in reading and writing , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
and you have to tell me which one .
and now you see it .
we &apos;re very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes , like language .
can i have the lights up again ?
here you see four gray tiles on your left , seven gray tiles on the right .
we do this in what we call the bee matrix .
the senses aren &apos;t fragile . and if they were , we wouldn &apos;t be here .
we &apos;re not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .

how does it work to make habitat for animals like me ? &quot;
and just beyond it you can see features that have vanished , things that have disappeared .
so , the red areas on this map indicate the places that are best for human sustainability on manhattan , places that are close to water , places that are near the harbor to fish , places protected from the winter winds .
or the bog turtle , needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places .
and these would be the kind of trees that might have been there , and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses , the butterflies , the fish in the stream , the birds in the trees .

and you may think that anesthetics work by sending you into some deep sleep , or by blocking your receptors so that you don &apos;t feel pain , but in fact most anesthetics don &apos;t work that way .
it was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expanded about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons , to produce this almost frightening organ , structure .
and it &apos;s not just for neuroscience ;
so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours .
there literally are only a handful of equations that you need to simulate the activity of the neocortex .
but i hope that you are at least partly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain .
it &apos;s when they stop you need to be worried .
and you associate it very powerfully .
thirdly , make it valuable . give people something with the sound .
an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and guide us to a new trajectory in america .
and of course our banks did as well , as did our federal government .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about dentists , vasectomies , guns and shark attacks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary , sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases .
the second of the four values is this movement toward ethics and fair play .
we &apos;re seeing on our data that consumers are realizing this is a marathon , not a sprint .
so , it &apos;s a consumer driven co-op .
and then we look at what companies can do .
what we &apos;re seeing with consumers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this recession .
the way that we did this is we tried to start with emily herself , who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory in marina del rey , and sit for a session in light stage 5 .
and by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination , the red and the green and the blue , diffuse the light differently , we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer .
and we &apos;re looking at taking this technology and applying it to whole human bodies .
not really . if it were that , i would just save you the talk , and teach you the gesture .
&quot; you come to work . how come you &apos;re so happy ? &quot;
so please , wait for the conductor .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll get the feeling that i really picked on him because he &apos;s old .
audience : itay talgam : good . now like a karajan . since you &apos;re already trained , let me concentrate , close my eyes . come , come .
well , it is different . but isn &apos;t that controlling in the same way ?
and look again at this kleiber .
and the second thing is it &apos;s about actually being in control , but in a very special way .
and even briefly , you become the storyteller to which the community , the whole community , listens to .
they started with two and they ended with two .
so , it &apos;s a normal-looking syringe .
over 20,000 economists whose job it is , competitive entry to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
one of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements will be moving from population pyramids to what we might term population coffins .
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 2030 , to destroy the planet , to wreck everything , through the creation , for example , of a biopathogen .
okay , so , most people only wondered that occasionally , like today , in breaks from whatever normally preoccupied them .
now , what had changed ?
empiricism is inadequate because , well , scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen .
and they don &apos;t perceive even those as what they really are , namely electrical crackles .
she cools his domain with spring air , venting heat up to the surface , creating summer .
it &apos;s the basic regulating principle of the enlightenment .
now , in order to do this , we need the right kind of language .
here , we &apos;ve got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into carbonate .
so , here is the technology we have today .
and finally , an observer in the future marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
and i had time to relax and to grieve .
my talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
and i started writing again .
on the 30th of may , 1832 , a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in paris .
because it is hard to make symmetry .
in which the essayist wrote , &quot; in everything , uniformity is undesirable .
what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same ?
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
you don &apos;t see any symmetry twice in any row or column .
this is a wall , a ceiling , and a floor .
rather than you all shouting out , i want you to count how many digits there are in that number . okay ?
g-h-e-z no , so2 has already been used , actually , in the mathematical language . so you can &apos;t have that one .
and within jewish teachings , the rabbinic teachings , we have hillel , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
it entails understanding the pain of the other .
and as he was dozing off , they were reading from the book of leviticus in the torah .
every week , the cleaner would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answered my plea again . &quot;
dayananda saraswati : the profound journey of compassion
the self : you are self-aware .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
that only confirms the reality that the wholeness cannot be different from you , cannot be minus you .
there is no shortcut : it is like swimming by swimming .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and so , i came to think that mama eternal , mama eternal , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that &apos;s compassion .
twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire affirming one message .
a good samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched in an immediate act of care and charity , but one who provides a system of sustained care -- i like that , &apos; a system of sustained care &apos; -- in the inn , take care .

he said , &quot; that is the battle of the self , the battle of the ego . &quot;
o , creator ! o , the objective ! the source of our being and the end of our journey ,
what is the imagery of god ?
it pairs closely with love , which is the will for the other to be happy ,
and he was rubbing it with a cloth .
and there are maggots in the flesh . and it &apos;s terrible .
he jumps back and there , of course , is the future buddha maitreya
a famous one , it &apos;s called the &quot; sevenfold causal method of developing compassion . &quot;
so , we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don &apos;t know .
nobody seems alien . they &apos;re not &quot; other . &quot; you reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .
but anyway , that &apos;s the &quot; lovely love . &quot;
and in buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hunter gatherer society that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions , no exposure to ethical philosophy , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deserves another , and that bad deeds should be punished .
so , it &apos;s these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world &apos;s trouble .
it &apos;s going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them .
any form of interdependence , or non-zero-sum relationship forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people .
and i &apos;m afraid we have another good news / bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .

and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
but what is really exceptional is the setting .
and if you think , it &apos;s permeated our whole culture , even our cities .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : at tedglobal u , cameron sinclair shows the unreported cost of real estate megaprojects gone bust : thousands of migrant construction laborers left stranded and penniless . to his fellow architects , he says there is only one ethical response .
now , recently i &apos;ve been told i &apos;ve been taking the high road .
for us at cambridge , it &apos;s as varied as the el niño oscillation , which affects weather and climate , to the assimilation of satellite data , to emissions from crops that produce biofuels , which is what i happen to study .

we use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other .

culture is a reaction to nature , and this understanding of our ancestors is transmitted generation from generation in the form of stories , symbols and rituals , which are always indifferent to rationality .
alexander &apos;s mother , his parents , his teacher aristotle told him the story of homer &apos;s &quot; iliad . &quot;
but they were not two characters on two different adventures .
and so , the denominator of alexander &apos;s life was one .
it &apos;s always about taste .
so , i had to take up a job . and i worked in the pharma industry . and i worked in the healthcare industry . and i worked as a marketing guy , and a sales guy , and a knowledge guy , and a content guy , and a training guy .
and i will share one of the rituals with you .
and everybody asks me , &quot; which is the better way , this way or that way ? &quot;
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .
and of these 25 percent that come to a police station , convictions are only in four percent of the cases .

i had a friend , a history major like me , who was accosted at schiphol airport in amsterdam , by an anxiously perspiring european saying , &quot; you &apos;re indian , you &apos;re indian ! can you help me fix my laptop ? &quot;
governments aren &apos;t very good at telling stories .
that &apos;s why india belongs at ted , and that &apos;s why ted belongs in india .
and at that young age , 10 years old , benki became the paje of his community .
for me , the world is veering towards a future we don &apos;t much want when we really think about it deep inside .
now i don &apos;t admit to that to anybody but my very close friends .

these are pieces that you won &apos;t find anywhere else in the world , in part because they document parts of history chinese choose to forget .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : rather than demo another new technology , tom wujec reaches back to one of our earliest but most ingenious devices -- the astrolabe . with thousands of uses , from telling time to mapping the night sky , this old tech reminds us that the ancient can be as brilliant as the brand-new .
so the north star corresponds to the center of the device .
but let me show you how to work this device .
so , in computer graphics and computer user interface design , there is a term called affordances .
so , what does the astrolabe inspire ?
you see , i was a study nerd .
and i &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful google and internet , to find the text of the telegram sent back from president buchanan to queen victoria .
india was not always like this level .
and they could raise the indian flag and become a sovereign nation , but in very big difficulties down there .
this is the big question today .
it &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
you see it came down there .
and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the governors of the world ?
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , and moderating the outputs at the other end .
no . but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are .
the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely .
and it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .
we &apos;re getting a lot of interest from government . ed miliband , the energy minister of this country , was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener .

dry areas cover more than one third of the earth &apos;s land surfaces .
this is where the village used to be .
but , by now , you &apos;re probably asking , how am i planning to solidify a sand dune ?
these are cavernous rock structures that i found on the site in sokoto .
and i think now is really the time to turn it into stone . thank you .
but it &apos;s not at the expense of people accepting their global responsibilities .
and whatever the short-run price for taking action on climate change or on security , or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education , these are prices that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries .
so , i think you &apos;re dealing with something that people instinctively see as part of their moral sense .
since then , the world has moved forward , partly as a result of what happened with the holocaust , and people &apos;s concern about the rights of individuals within territories where they need protection , partly because of what we saw in rwanda , partly because of what we saw in bosnia .
america has made its first disposition on this with the bill that president obama should be congratulated for getting through congress .
ca : prime minister , i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreciative of the efforts you made in terms of the financial mess we got ourselves into .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is confined to zero volume .
i only need two things .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the starlight comes out from .
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars orbit the black hole .
and this animation here shows you one example of the techniques that we use , called adaptive optics .
so , there was actually lots of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
it strips that gas cloud apart .
so , we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting .
but suppose you use the green technology , solar pumps -- they are of no use in this area .
because we are used to get written things .
the government thought that this is a very backward area and we should bring a multi-million dollar project to bring water from the himalayas .
you won &apos;t find water in this slide .
but perhaps they knew that on sixth , november , 2009 , there will be a ted green and blue session , so they painted it like this .

they died of aids last year .
and so here is what i came up with . i start fiddling with it .
by toy i mean , something you play with that doesn &apos;t have a particular goal .
it &apos;s all &quot; figure . &quot;
now , if you could pick up the black vase , it would look like the figure on top .
here , let &apos;s make it a little harder . still pretty easy .
and it has to be solvable in a magazine .
then recently &quot; rock band &quot; has been a big hit .
you get more -- down , okay , yeah where is that ? oh , yeah . there , okay . j-o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bow . that bow helps .
one of the -- thank you for inviting us .
and she &apos;s desperate to find more evidence for the link .
another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in 2002 -- that was to the building ; the people weren &apos;t listening .
and when the crisis was happening , the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said , &quot; events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . &quot;
i can &apos;t do the whole thing because it would take too long , it really would .
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu-ca-ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
that was easy , but then i made the decision , maybe arbitrary , that they needed to be people of a certain age , which at that point , when i created this program , seemed really old .
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the brush in their self-portrait .
and so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say , to break out of their own cocoon of the public self ,
when we were alone , i was her audience .
she wanted the control of her final moment , and she did it amazingly .
he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve read everything , and sometimes mr. jefferson would smooth the truth a bit . &quot;
and she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life .
&lt; speaker &gt; thulasiraj ravilla &lt; / speaker &gt;
a typical day at aravind , we would do about a thousand surgeries , maybe see about 6,000 patients , send out teams into the villages to examine , bring back patients , lots of telemedicine consultations , and , on top of that , do a lot of training , both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of aravind .
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves ,
we designed a van with a vsat , which sends out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnosed ,
and , of course , one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away what you have as a surplus .
and there are many which fit this paradigm .
well , i &apos;ve got to tell you , it &apos;s just not going to be pretty .
so , for example , there is the character of noora .
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually interacts with our daily life .
she also embraced violence .
and as we were eating , i had the distinct feeling that i was back in the city of london , having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist .
and the ira , which control the private transportation system in northern ireland , did exactly the same thing .
so , this was a vital injection of cash into the u.s. economy . now , when i went to look at the figures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the federal reserve prints every year in order to satisfy the increase in the demand for dollars , which , of course , reflects the growth of the economy .
now , you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and banking .

in 2007 i went to liberia , where a group of my friends and i did an independent , self-funded film , still in progress , on a very legendary and brutal war-lord named general butt naked .

in the last four years , we &apos;ve seen all kinds of memes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page .

the first step is pattern recognition .
what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the ink in which these words are printed .
but this is how metaphor misleads .
the latin word &quot; cogito &quot; is derived from the prefix &quot; co , &quot; meaning &quot; together , &quot; and the verb &quot; agitare , &quot; meaning &quot; to shake . &quot;
i definitely did not have any grand strategy or plan to pursue and find for-profit solutions to addressing pressing public issues .
bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side ,
and in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands using existing and legitimate tools like the right to information act , video , audio , or peer pressure , we have successfully obtained whatever our clients set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe .

if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy drivers .
in the middle of stars , you &apos;re joining hydrogen together to make helium and then helium together to make carbon , to make oxygen , all the things that you &apos;re made of are made in the middle of stars .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neutron , so you can make that happen .
and , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .
we have to start putting electricity on the grid in this very complex technology .
here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you .
our collective vision at naya jeevan , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; new life &quot; in urdu and hindi , is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families by providing them with affordable access to catastrophic health care .
when i took this picture , the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night .
you know , when people speak about pioneering spirit , very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas .
when brian jones and i were flying around the world , the weather man asked us , one day , to fly quite low , and very slow .
that &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
pioneering spirit should continue , but on another level .
and that &apos;s exactly why we try to do it .
so , we have to start , and show the example .

sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
and that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpret that person &apos;s behavior .
but if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if i now watch you being touched , i literally feel it in my hand .

normally , i would start at 38 beats per minute , and while holding my breath , it would drop to 12 beats per minute , which is pretty unusual .

you &apos;re going down into our lobby , go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium .

what you see here is a prototypic device .
and here you simply burn it .
the printers cost 800 bucks now .
&quot; have you taken it every day ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor ,
the answer is that what you do , and the details are not terribly important here , is to make something more elaborate : you take several different layers of paper , each one containing its own little fluid system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , double-sided carpet tape , the stuff you use to stick the carpets onto the floor .
and we sat down , we did the physics of eggbeaters and self-aligning tubes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journal .
so , i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
we &apos;ve made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia , where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission ,
you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
it is absolutely archaic that we call cancer by prostate , by breast , by muscle .
the website says , &quot; if you look , there &apos;s an individual mutation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot;
the key is , when you look at these variables and you look at this data , you have to understand the data inputs .
well , the bad news is that these robust -- and robust is a key word -- emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail .
so the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting that complex system , just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence , chemotherapy may work by that same exact way .
she goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway , and again , i &apos;m not sure if this pathway was in the system , in the cancer , but it targeted a pathway , and a month later , pow , that cancer &apos;s gone .
the ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening .
and so , i implore everyone here : think differently . come up with new ideas .
and one is meaningless without the other .
didn &apos;t have any control over the spigot remotely .
it could be tomato sauce , or anything could be dispensed -- sand , powders or anything like that .
and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observations and apparatus , especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
and at first , the parkinson &apos;s was really upsetting , because i couldn &apos;t get the pencil to stand still .
one is the large global economy , the large globalized economy ,
and yet , we all rejected this project ,
so this is what i mean with a failing governance structure , because even the powerful government , which we have in germany , comparatively , was not able to say , &quot; we will not allow our companies to bribe abroad . &quot;
we had a longer-term time perspective .
and this is possible because civil society joined the companies and joined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of remedies , in the implementation of reforms , and then later , in the monitoring of reforms .
i &apos;m not a doctor ;
england is right behind you , as usual .
i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about :
an inspirational man ,
thirty years ago , most of the food was largely local and largely fresh .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a specialist in .
you know , the amount of additives , e numbers , ingredients you wouldn &apos;t believe --
i want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we &apos;re in , guys , ok ?
now , i don &apos;t know about you guys , but judging the circumstances , right , any judge in the whole world , would look at the statistics and the evidence , and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse . that &apos;s my belief .
i know how they do it .
and for me , it &apos;s quite romantic ,
and look , i know it &apos;s weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with seadragon , that &apos;s where it comes from .
so you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery is integrating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
ok , never mind .
thank you all very much .
so what follows from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and policing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money -- you &apos;re going to have a pretty miserable time .
you had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information because travel was so restricted .
think of the huge change that means :
how do you do it ? well , we &apos;ve had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .
thank you .
alan kay calls it , &quot; technology is anything that was invented after you were born . &quot;
well , that &apos;s because they &apos;re all young .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a mcluhan sense , an external stomach ,
but it &apos;s also law . and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us .
there is more energy flowing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
and that &apos;s the thing that bothers most people , is that progress is really real , but we wonder and question : what are the environmental costs of it ?
you try it out .
what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences :

ted talk subtitles and transcript : the second deadliest day in the history of mount everest climbs happened in 1996 -- and ken kamler was the only doctor on the mountain that day . he shares the incredible story of the climbers &apos; battle to save lives in extreme conditions , and uses brain imaging technology to map the medical miracle of one man who survived roughly 36 hours buried in the snow .
campthree is at the base of lhotse ,
this is me crossing a crevasse .
this is a picture of rob hall .
i have an oxygen hose connected here .
we also got some bad news in the storm that beck weathers , another climber , had collapsed in the snow and was dead .
the ones that weren &apos;t that lucid or were not that well coordinated , i would give an injection of steroids to try to give them some period of lucidity and coordination where they could then work their way further down the mountain .
some of them were hypothermic , some of them were frostbitten , some were both .
after laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
he &apos;s collapsed in the snow here . everything is quiet ,
so this is what i can speculate might have been going on had we been able to do a spect scan on beck during this survival epic .

in the new england journal of medicine , there was a study published that showed that with appropriate rewarming , people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems .
you know ?
and when you go into the research institute , and you say , &quot; hi . i &apos;d like to buy some concentrated , compressed gas cylinders of a lethal gas because i have these ideas , see , about wanting to suspend people .
so we started to think : is this the agent that might have been present in the skier , and might have she had more of it than someone else , and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died , as we found out with our worm experiments ?
and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people .
and a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it &apos;s our system whispering to them which pill they need to take , and they fake like they &apos;re having a conversation with a friend .
and then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this newfangled technology to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : questions of good and evil , right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science . but sam harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life .
now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape :
just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute :
and torturing and killing young women .
how is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
and so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- i think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .

but because two-thirds of the earth is covered by water , the land area on mars is comparable to the land area on earth .

elizabeth pisani : sex , drugs and hiv -- let &apos;s get rational
it &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
&quot; no , no . we share needles because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
there is nothing on the other side .
now , in the rest of the world , we &apos;ve got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very , very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of hiv in these other populations who are at highest risk : drug injectors , sex workers and gay men .
well , you die , so your viral load goes to zero .
we &apos;ve talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days ,
so it &apos;s rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that &apos;s made by a politician , and it &apos;s rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .

it &apos;s a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
so we have two prototypes .
ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
the students like to have fun . and here you can see that it &apos;s walking over unstructured terrain .
the best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cord , umbilical cord . so , we &apos;re still using an external power source and external computation .

but can i use a paper towel ? the answer to this can be found in embodied energy .

but we &apos;re just going to zip right past this area , this area that includes about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-ocean ridge , which i think is even more extraordinary .
and before the discovery of these vents , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis . but down there , there is no sun , there is no photosynthesis ;
so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .

what allows women to replant trees , to rebuild societies , to lead radical , non-violent movements for social change ?
this is tradition . &quot;
she starts every lecture with a prayer , but she &apos;s a single , feisty , financially independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12 .
so enter a group of out dykes , young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from macedonia to bosnia , from serbia to slovenia .
but she was sick with worry :
with their remaining funds , they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks
that &apos;s the heat from the bottom .
we can use our tradition to navigate change .
and i &apos;m happy to say that that &apos;s led to many good things in r &amp; amp ; d and education , lots of other areas .
this science is different , more general , than the mathematics-based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that computes answers to questions .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broadly , to democratize all of this knowledge , and to try and be an authoritative source in all areas . to be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have , not by searching what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compute fresh new answers to specific questions .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
something like rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good randomness generator .
one &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
that &apos;s one of the ways that you get towards true complexity .
and no matter how long i &apos;ve spent on the ocean , i haven &apos;t yet managed to muster a decent beard , and i hope that it remains that way .

i just felt like a movie star .
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
awful , really awful .
and this is really bad news because plastic is not an inert substance .
i found out that people had rowed across oceans .
i plan on being around for a long time , and when i &apos;m 90 years old , i want to be happy and healthy .
the trouble is , i don &apos;t .
and the other , of course , is a birth control pill , which , in a very simple way , fundamentally changed the structure of society
and , interestingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
and it &apos;s like the traffic that you see . the amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does maintain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells ,
the question is : why is binary simpler than arabic ?
with integrated circuits , you can build cellphones .
that is , you can stack them .
that is to say , if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work , it will be applicable to a very , very large variety of human conditions ,
at the components from which the system is made and examine their fragility , or their stability ,
and also , could you create the worst possible tedtalk that they would still let you get away with ?
you &apos;ll all stay with me .

and the gdp in africa is not making much progress .
and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
but how do you do that ? do you hire teachers ? do you build more schools ?
but maybe there is another problem as well .
that &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good improvement .
well , what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed nets , the coverage rate really falls down a lot .
and then canals were built , and with the same horseman and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much cargo .
and they are good , scientific , robust answers .
with deworming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .

and it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products .
it &apos;s also responsible for all human behavior , all decision-making , and it has no capacity for language .
samuel pierpont langley was given 50,000 dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine .
they tell stories of how every time the wright brothers went out , they would have to take five sets of parts , because that &apos;s how many times they would crash before supper .
because , you see , the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first .
i mean , we use tivo as verb .
he went around and told people what he believed .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
and she was hot .
people came to study our reefs from australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to theirs .
and it &apos;s really hard to conjure up much of a sense of well-being , because it just keeps getting worse .
and they tasted really good .
it was accidentally released from the aquarium in monaco ,
you &apos;re looking at one toxic dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish ,
i think it &apos;s sort of funny ; it &apos;s on the siberian coast ,
and the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put humpty dumpty back together again ?
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
is it that i analyze the data very well ?
that is a great tragedy -- which i &apos;m carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profession still legitimizes publication of knowledge of people without attributing them by making them anonymous .
it depends upon how you look at the life of the people .
do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ?
now , this lady , on the wall of the dung cake heap , has made a painting .
they don &apos;t want second-standard , second-quality outputs .
and that is what mansukh bhai prajapati has done .
saidullah sahib is an amazing man .
because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then climb her &#91; unclear &#93; would climb on that .
and this breathing apparatus now saved the life ,
&lt; / doc &gt;
so i started to see the world in a completely new way
this here shows , on the y-axis , the increase in the probability that a person is obese given that a social contact of theirs is obese
blame your fat friends . &quot; what was interesting to us is that the european headline writers had a different take : they said , &quot; are your friends gaining weight ? perhaps you are to blame . &quot;
and , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
and you might form the intuition that the unhappy people occupy a different structural location within the network .
they would say , &quot; i &apos;ve got six friends . that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
it is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts .
we invent .
so we made this thing .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
and once you see blood vessels , we think we can see the malaria .
there &apos;s all these different interventions
now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with ddt .
and farmers could protect their crops that they want to sell to whole foods because our photons are 100 percent organic .
here you can see that the insects are being tracked as they &apos;re flying around , which is kind of fun .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and it has several uninhabited , unfished , pristine islands and a few inhabited islands .
most of the biomass is low on the food chain , the herbivores , the parrotfish , the surgeonfish that eat the algae .
in fanning island , the corals are not recovered .
so let me just give you a summary of what no-take reserves do . these places , when we protect them ,
so the fishermen are catching more .
so how much of this do we have ?
well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reserves :
enric sala : thank you . ca : that was a masterful job of pulling things together .
es : and then we have the under-performance of fisheries that is 50 billion dollars .
i teach high school math .
this is really destructive .
but what you have here is actually four separate layers ,
he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the u.s. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
so i won &apos;t talk about it .
which , wow .
and she goes , &quot; and what &apos;s this fertilizing ? &quot;
&quot; human males and females develop a special bond , and when they &apos;re much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be naked together . &quot;
so we put in dogs mating , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally absorbed .
now , the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they &apos;re growing in .
and on the other end , excessive angiogenesis -- too many blood vessels -- drives disease ,
cancer cells mutate , and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors , natural fertilizer , that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer . and once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues ,
and over the course of seven months , the cancers completely disappeared , and the biopsies came back as normal .
but i actually took a completely opposite approach , and began asking : what could we be adding to our diet that &apos;s naturally antiangiogenic , and that could boost the body &apos;s defense system , and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
statins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs , and a few others -- they inhibit angiogenesis , too .
if you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .

and i guess i just wasn &apos;t quite ready .
so , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your pocketbook , for the environment , for the animals : what &apos;s stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot ?
and when i came at age 22 to live on fernandina ,
the other thing is , i &apos;ve never met anybody that really doesn &apos;t say that they like penguins .
and you can imagine sleeping on fernandina your first night there and you hear this lonesome , plaintful call .
so when i went to study the magellanic penguins , i didn &apos;t have any problems .
because they don &apos;t pay the real environmental costs .
and what the penguins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the penguins &apos; positions were for penguins in incubation in 2003 --
this is turbo the penguin .
okay , so here are a few penguins coming in .
the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
so oil is playing a less significant role every year .
and it &apos;s just limestone , nothing really special about it .
and i &apos;ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this chalk .
so this is the first self-replicating species that we &apos;ve had on the planet whose parent is a computer .
so , substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially .
so our team developed new techniques for actually growing , cloning entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast .
we felt one of the tenets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could distinguish synthetic dna from natural dna .
and they came down on the side of open publication , which is the right approach --
we need some alternatives for oil .
i mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously ,
you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
&quot; as our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew .
they see no reason to do this .
&quot; always . i &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot;
kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels , you know , with their resumes -- flicking through and saying , &quot; what , this is it ? &quot;
my wife &apos;s just finished writing a novel , and i think it &apos;s a great book , but she disappears for hours on end .
and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
you might also be asking whether it &apos;s possible that this is illegal for her to do this .
they can take any element from any garment from the history of fashion and incorporate it into their own design .
tom ford : and we found after much research that -- actually not much research , quite simple research -- that the counterfeit customer was not our customer .
it forced him to be a little more innovative .
and that &apos;s sort of like the novelty standard for a u.s. patent , which fashion designers never get -- rarely get here in the states .
hairdos , no copyright protection .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
sharmeen obaid-chinoy : inside a school for suicide bombers
ha : if god gives me strength .
step five : i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of propaganda .
singer : ♫ on the day of judgment ♫ ♫ my god will call me ♫ ♫ my body will be put back together ♫ ♫ and god will ask me why i did this ♫ soc : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circumstances , faced with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the glorious afterlife ?
and then we get a pandemic .
so let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
so that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
so what happened ?
with a range of new technologies , we could .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
it probably isn &apos;t the perfect vaccine , but it &apos;s moving along .
perfect .
they want to regulate us , those conservatives , to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re emulating the original mashup .
now , my concern is , we dems , too often , not so much .
and we should remember who employed the sharecroppers :
but then i went to the site and all of the audio in my site had been silenced .
openness is a commitment to a certain set of values .
and to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter .
the luminous room is a system in which it &apos;s considered that input and output spaces are co-located .
it projects down digital shadows , as you see here .
let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
so here &apos;s a familiar place .
all right . so collaborative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corporations and movie producers ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
they only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
as i wandered around and made these pictures , it sort of occurred to me that the ocean &apos;s not a grocery store , you know .
largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago .
but , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water .
the north atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast of north america , united states and canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story i did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story .
i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea , and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
and that &apos;s led to this discussion that &apos;s completely raw , completely unfiltered .
so somebody at time , at the magazine , thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year .
they took the youtube video and they mashed everything in the video .
but i think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places , now , where you can go and not have identity , to be completely anonymous and say whatever you &apos;d like .
you &apos;ve got this surprising semi-underground influence , but it &apos;s not making you a lot of money , yet .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 876 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
so it isn &apos;t in the series .
so what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon europa , which is a thick sheet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers thick .
what about scientific discovery ?
it &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies .
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
it &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it .
&quot; we know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song .
you know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .
we are ok go . have you read the &quot; natural curiosity cabinet ? &quot;
we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument .
who else ?
now , flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case .
someone who would not grant casey martin the right to a golf cart ,
that &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ms : what &apos;s your name ? ms : warren .
and that walking was not essential , but incidental .
that illustrates that with golf , as with flutes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grappling with the question , &quot; what is the essential nature of the activity in question ,
thank you very much .
john kasaona : how poachers became caretakers
he said , &quot; john , i want you to become a good herder .
our livestock was almost at the brink of extinction , protected as well .
three things that actually help to build on this foundation :
the other partners that we have got is business communities .
this is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .
remember me asking a few questions which still preoccupy me .
you have a series of buttons . you actually choose your lift music .
a yellow sign ? that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;ll be expecting .
but what &apos;s interesting about that suggestion was that , to implement that suggestion wouldn &apos;t cost 10 million pounds ; it wouldn &apos;t involve large amounts of expenditure ; it would actually cost about 50 quid .
that &apos;s called trivia .
which means we &apos;re going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts , if at all .
nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
in terms of weapons , the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy .
mark jacobson : thank you .
let &apos;s say we converted all the vehicles in the united states to battery electric vehicles , hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on e85 .
we have facilities around there . you also have a buffer zone that &apos;s 17 square kilometers .
and we can guarantee a clean , blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power .
there &apos;s absolutely no need for nuclear power .
anyone else for ? go .
your final pitch , stewart .
so , people of the ted community , i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
&quot; by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
there &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
he wanted a little more bombast ,
and a new form of music was born .
people began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems .
in other ways , it &apos;s more like the west african music because if the music in an mp3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
and they &apos;ll vote for that .
which translates to &quot; pseudoscientific baloney &quot; -- would be the nice word -- in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good ,
a type i error , or false positive , is believing a pattern is real when it &apos;s not .
and is it really a horse ?
while you &apos;re thinking about that , this was an experiment done by susan blackmore , a psychologist in england , who showed subjects this degraded image and then ran a correlation between their scores on an esp test : how much did they believe in the paranormal , supernatural , angels and so forth .
too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reveal .
especially when they &apos;re upside down ,
some conspiracies really are true .
narrator : this is the venue they chose for their fake auditions for an advert for lip balm .
it &apos;s a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .
well , most rights owners , instead of blocking , will allow the copy to be published .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s a big problem , and it &apos;s complicated and messy .
thank you so much . i &apos;m going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater acoustic world of whales and dolphins .
it &apos;s really important for our music and our language .
whereas these members of a pair go &quot; wo-ot , wo-ot , wo-ot . &quot;
to me , the most mind-bending example of the interconnectedness of the ocean where oceanographers took a ship to the southern indian ocean , deployed an underwater loudspeaker and played back a sound .
this means that humpback song is a form of animal culture , just like music for humans would be .
here &apos;s the same call recorded from a hydrophone 500 miles away .
and this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right whale mothers and calves as they separate to come back again .
so at this point , it &apos;s primarily an issue of cost and standards .
but then they often wait there .
and what i &apos;ve been really passionate about ever since -- and i &apos;ve never spoken about this ever , until now -- so this is the first time anyone &apos;s ever heard it , except my wife three days ago , because she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; and i told her -- is that i think we miss an opportunity
i think we have an obligation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish --
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed .
the definition of an entrepreneur is &quot; a person who organizes , operates and assumes the risk of a business venture . &quot;
i even knew at a seven-year-old age that i could actually get a fractional percent of a cent , and people would pay that because it multiplied up .
you &apos;ve got this demand over here that has money .
and i thought that was kind of cool .
and people could never get their bags up it .
i had the pinnacles and ddhs and the really cool ones back then .
allowances teach kids the wrong habits .
maybe four nights out of the week read them bedtime stories and three nights of the week have them tell stories .
look for that kind of stuff .

but i needed something else .
she was also called simhanandini , the one who rode the lion .
as i spent time with vivian , i saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre in how she did her work .
i took one psychology class in college , and i learned about this guy , abraham maslow , as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs .
what we can measure is that tangible stuff at the bottom of the pyramid .
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in bhutan --
or in other words , i think the bhutanese believe happiness equals wanting what you have --
as you look at these two columns here , doesn &apos;t it make you feel like it &apos;s time for us to start figuring out a new way to count , a new way to imagine what &apos;s important to us in life ?
i guess i &apos;m sort of a curious ceo .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
but i find that for myself , without exception , the more i deal with the work as something of my own , as something that is personal , the more successful it is as something that &apos;s compelling , interesting and sustaining .
and this way , working with the art director , i &apos;m able to bring it to just the right point that it &apos;s puzzling for the audience -- they can figure out that there &apos;s something they have to read -- but it &apos;s not impossible for them to read .
so i &apos;m using my own writings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an interdependency between word and image as a kind of seductive force .
and those who didn &apos;t respond will never receive anything from me ever again .
i &apos;m just really , really thrilled with them .
so that &apos;s why i do what i do , and why i spend so much time and effort on it , and why i work in the commercial , public sphere , as opposed to the isolated , private sphere of fine art :
the question that you will ask will determine much of the answer that you get .
it was boring .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain .
well , education is a global religion .
so time and again , i found people like this .
so i met this character , steven .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
there are formal settings -- schools , colleges , hospitals -- in which innovation can take place , and informal settings -- communities , families , social networks .
and finally , you need transformational innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways .
when i was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .

and we put down those little floor tiles ,
i &apos;m kind of into this stuff , and i &apos;m going to stop being embarrassed . &quot;
there &apos;s a whole gray market for lego , thousands of home-based businesses .
and there was a lawyer in nairobi , ory okolloh -- who some of you may know from her tedtalk -- who began blogging about it on her site , kenyan pundit .
now what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technology .
now i want to stipulate , as the lawyers say , that lolcats are the stupidest possible creative act .
they studied those daycare centers at the time of highest tension , which is pick-up time .
nothing changes .
the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow ,
i think there are any number of reasons ,
but is it practical ?
and they now have a relatively central location .
and especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
this was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
but daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
they have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
and those simple themes aren &apos;t really themes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to preserve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . heal the ocean . &quot;
pcbs accumulate in dolphins in sarasota bay , in texas , in north carolina .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the pyramid .
these same infections create harmful algal blooms .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pioneering spirit into this .
&#91; the himalayas . &#93; the flat horizon that we &apos;ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .
but these are positions , the latest positions of exoplanets that we &apos;ve mapped ,
so i &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is .
it is the landscape , right ?

others of them are very real , in a certain sense .
to the right , i took a higher roughness .
enormous disagreements .
mathematicians began to create shapes that didn &apos;t exist .
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .
what got you to be , at the same time , a mechanical engineer , a geographer and a mathematician and so on , a physicist ?
that is the meat , the problem .

so we said screw it , we &apos;ll just start our own company , which we did three years ago .
and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat .
but people do because it &apos;s so cheap ,
the icons like michael pollan and jamie oliver in his ted prize wish both addressed this last three-decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .

prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
this is mr. lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months ,
in the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
so there they are .
will they move on ?
they get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin
remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
and the same thing with the atmosphere :
you see a lot of oil on the ocean .
and so you can see , literally , signs of their shock , signs of their outrage , signs of their anger , and signs of their grief .
when it breaks up , it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .
so the gulf is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlantic ocean .
so this is a hemispheric issue .
there is ample opportunity for oil and dirty water to get in behind them .
that &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
the first offshore drills were called harpoons .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shorten our lives .
and that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
so what sex does is it enables the individual to draw upon the genetic innovations of the whole species .
so oz is better at both spears and axes than adam .
in other words , the average person on the average wage could not afford a candle in 1800 .
we &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s standards of living through the sexual division of labor .
and that will have led to specialization .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : listening to stories widens the imagination ; telling them lets us leap over cultural walls , embrace different experiences , feel what others feel . elif shafak builds on this simple idea to argue that fiction can overcome identity politics .

so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than turkish characters ,

in that sense , i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .

ca : so you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it ,
ja : yep . yeah , and trusted people .
ca : capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
bruce wayne , who becomes batman , loses his parents at the age of six in gotham city .
but in 1492 , two important things happen .
everybody believes the koran is for all time and all place .
and the swiss psychoanalyst , carl jung , also spoke about the importance of the number three in all cultures , so i figure i &apos;m covered .
she said , &quot; that &apos;s not me . &quot; i said , &quot; look at the eyes . they &apos;re your eyes . &quot;
next thing you knew , there &apos;s a full page covering us positively ,
what &apos;s happening ?
miklos : no . he gave me access , and you want to reboot the &#91; unclear &#93; . no more &#91; unclear &#93; . &#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
this is islam &apos;s influence on hinduism and judaism .
just today , d.c. comics announced the cover of our upcoming crossover .
the dna matched ,
the way we do that , actually , is with a method , which we call the transit method .
the small planets dominated , and there was a certain harmony to that , which actually copernicus was very happy to note , and kepler was one of the big proponents of .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
and that &apos;s a very basic question , which we don &apos;t know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
our breakthrough was to create an algorithm that unfolds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
and now that that &apos;s done , we can choose a movement-based action .
eg : losing concentration .
we are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today ,
what if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature , or within our own stem cells ?
and i started first with cow achilles tendon ,
we can use thicker , younger , better tissues than you might have injured in your knee , or that you might have when you &apos;re 40 , 50 or 60 .
&quot; i know , &quot; i said . &quot; i &apos;m aware of this custom .
this is the only way to ensure that your preferences and interests will be most fully accounted for .
for them , choice was not just a way of defining and asserting their individuality , but a way to create community and harmony by deferring to the choices of people whom they trusted and respected .
i was so struck by this comment that from then on , i started to offer all the participants those seven sodas ,
they practice this from such an early age that they &apos;ve come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability .
what do they do ?
the story americans tell , the story upon which the american dream depends , is the story of limitless choice .
sheena , there is a detail about your biography that we have not written in the program book .
and what i wondered was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color ,
so my project is along the northwest atlantic .
but i was the recipient of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason .
i felt like my throat was on fire .
independent researchers found that .
so from a toxicology perspective , this is really awful because corexit and the dispersed oil are much more toxic together than either alone .
so we know from previous spills .
the corexit is transporting the oil into every membrane and every system of the body .
we have some of the partners lined up .
&#91; stretching across to sado &#93; &#91; the milky way &#93; . &quot; basho was a brilliant man .
and basically , our challenge is to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks of living on a planet that &apos;s driven by only two processes , two sources of energy ,
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interacting , partly as a function of temperature , partly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
this is very , very exciting .
we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communicating in real time .
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own port .
and these are the things that we &apos;re funded to do today .
it &apos;s far beyond what we currently have .
but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspects of your own mistakes .
so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at .
so we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just suck it up and teach monkeys how to use money .
and so our monkey marketplace was born .
question is : do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do ?
people are a little risk-averse . so what ?
that means when we &apos;re in a risk mindset -- excuse me , when we &apos;re in a loss mindset , we actually become more risky , which can actually be really worrying .
maybe we should see how they do with losses .
because we &apos;ve answered the question we started out with .
we actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means , seemingly pretty easily .
and then i said to myself , i &apos;ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
many , many people have died on mt . everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
and there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on mt . everest .
and then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
i assessed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them .
because the people who were gathering brazil nuts weren &apos;t the same people who were cutting the forests .
if we were farmers , we &apos;d be eating our seed .
we can get efficiency up .
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terribly informed .
are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers ?
after 40 years , the global organic movement has achieved 0.7 of one percent of global food .
the good news is we identified a hundred companies two years ago .
but they &apos;re doing some really interesting things around chocolate , and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future .
the issue isn &apos;t what to think , it &apos;s how to think .
many of you have been there . it &apos;s not the real china .
she went to vocational school for accounting .
well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
the second item on the agenda is maternal mortality .
the doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor , she was really clever , and they made her a nurse .
and then , when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods from the village to the marketplace , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hired her husband .
she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on scholarship .
so then , i ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
&lt; speaker &gt; peter molyneux &lt; / speaker &gt;
his parents are too busy to listen to his problems , and that &apos;s when he starts almost conjuring you up .
so we &apos;ve tackled that problem , and we &apos;ve come up with a solution , which we &apos;ll see in a second .
they &apos;re fine with teaching milo for the first few throws , but then they want to beat milo , where women , they &apos;re more nurturing about this .
now &apos;s a chance for dimitri to kind of reassure and calm milo down .
the cool thing is that we &apos;re doing as well : as you interact with him , you &apos;re able to put things into his world ; he recognizes objects .
an unfortunate connection for us maybe , but it reminds me that we &apos;d like to thank one man for , over the past decade , working tirelessly to support comedians all around the world , specifically comedians with a middle eastern background .
first , the axis guys recorded a comedy central special
anywhere you go .
we have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
the other founding members included ahmed ahmed , who is an egyptian-american , who actually had the idea to go to the middle east and try it out .
his name was jabbar . &quot;
that &apos;s what i try and show in my stand-up . there &apos;s good people everywhere .
i was in oman , and i was in saudi arabia .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
who knows , maybe one day we &apos;ll even have our own james bond , right .
it &apos;s filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren &apos;t that fun .
i mean , we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable and makes it , you know , productive down the road .
so i just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
you should lose points for not doing this on time .
and at princeton , they &apos;ve actually experimented with this ,
and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses .
and so , i &apos;ve got about 20 seconds left ,
20 billion for this war .
and when you &apos;re lost in information , an information map is kind of useful .
but april isn &apos;t a particularly massive month for video games .
any other guesses ?
it &apos;s being poured into our eyes through the web , and we &apos;re all visualizers now ; we &apos;re all demanding a visual aspect to our information .
massive . 609 billion in 2008 -- 607 , rather .
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture ,
and then i can say , &quot; well , just show me the stuff that affects heart health . &quot;
so that &apos;s what &apos;s exciting to me , seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind midstream -- beautiful , lovely data .
early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes to kill the pain of it .
at the peak of activity earlier this year , the researchers lowered the drill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another 365 years deeper into the past .
we banned those chemicals , and we replaced them , unknowingly , with other substances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more potent as heat-trapping , greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide .
jim toomey : learning from sherman the shark
and i flew in a small plane low over the islands .
it would start a whole new space race .
let &apos;s see .
so , imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom .
and it ended up in the boise river and then on to the columbia river and then to the mouth of the columbia and to the pacific ocean and then on to this place called the great pacific garbage patch -- which is this giant pacific gyre in the north pacific , where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around -- and then back onto the lagoon .
meanwhile , ernest finds his fins on the internet .
and you realize where you are ; you &apos;re in the louvre .
i highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday , because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture on the geopolitics of oil again .
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it &apos;s absolutely explosive .
i mean -- and this is funny ,
there were puffs under the little colorless eyes with creases running from them . &quot;
but it &apos;s also really important that we don &apos;t get distracted by the theater or the morals of it .
i was there in 2003 .
gasoline costs are a tremendous drain on the american economy , but they &apos;re also a drain on individual families
and you can find more about this policy .
but in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hydrocarbon .
it &apos;s the same with brands :
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anticipate they &apos;ll do .
you can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the conservative party did earlier this year with their election poster .
he said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
come on . in the western world , we have enough .
these seem to be natural human aspirations .
and the yellow dot there you see , is the global average .
what &apos;s happening in costa rica ?
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
and we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course .
and we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the happy planet index .
we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today . the mesopotamian culture : we invent agriculture , we domesticate animals and plants .
the decade when we have to bend the curves .
and could we even , thanks to major advancements in earth systems science , identify the thresholds , the points where we may expect nonlinear change ?
well , there &apos;s no science to suggest .
it has to basically do this on current land .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
it more felt to be the case to me that i was being treated like a statue , and i was to sit in one place like a statue would .
but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the muslim and buddhist traditions .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even in inviting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen ,
ideally you would not be satisfied until you &apos;d actually done the work . but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
rachel sussman : the world &apos;s oldest living things
one was when i had been dropped off by boat on a remote fjord , only to find that the archeologists i was supposed to meet were nowhere to be found .
this is at about 60 feet or 18 meters , depth .
any guesses ?
and what &apos;s more , it &apos;s actually a tree .
this is the clonal mojave yucca , it &apos;s about a mile away , and it &apos;s a little bit older than 12,000 years .
thank you .
they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time .
and when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
the first experiment i did out of newcastle was actually done in india .
and then that &apos;s her over there .
&quot; you can exchange groups .
the granny cloud sits over there .
i sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students .
education is self-organizing system , where learning is an emergent phenomenon .
my brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting .
and that fascinated me , to explore that territory .
detail .
it &apos;s just created by the mind .
i couldn &apos;t find it .
it &apos;s just all about questioning the preconceptions .
that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture &#91; the &#93; invisible .
it &apos;s called &quot; breath . &quot; it &apos;s just two holes on the gallery wall .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : after 15 years in the british diplomatic corps , carne ross became a &quot; freelance diplomat , &quot; running a bold nonprofit that gives small , developing and yet-unrecognized nations a voice in international relations . at the bif-5 conference , he calls for a new kind of diplomacy that gives voice to small countries , that works with changing boundaries and that welcomes innovation .
and my ambition was sealed .
i negotiated for my country the resolution in the security council of the 12th of september 2001 condemning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .
what was i going to do ?
and i gave it up .
and the kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service .
and watching ? what if !
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separation to the al-shabaab militia in somalia .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
&lt; speaker &gt; ben cameron &lt; / speaker &gt;
these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain .
but the number of arts participants , people who write poetry , who sing songs , who perform in church choirs , is exploding beyond our wildest imaginations .
ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of regressive and onerous immigration laws , in reality tv that thrives on humiliation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repeatedly , day-in , day-out in the united states , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; ladies and gentlemen , please report any suspicious behavior or suspicious individuals to the authorities nearest you , &quot;
if you were to ask me , you know , &quot; what do you worry about the most ?
we are , right now , at 390 parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere .
but to answer that question , to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agents of change .
and we drilled in the ross sea .
this sediment is 100 percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants .
it &apos;s about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .
the core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone .
it &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
you know , we &apos;ve warmed the globe about a degree centigrade in the last century , and there &apos;s nothing in the natural part of that record that resembles what we &apos;ve seen in the last century .
and we take samples of the sediment , and it tells us the co2 level of the ocean , and therefore the co2 level of the atmosphere .
but recently , i &apos;ve become intrigued by a different way of thinking of large human crowds ,
raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers ,
and amazingly , you can still see what the best can do , because the crowd itself shines a light on them ,
so , at ted , we &apos;ve become a little obsessed with this idea of openness .
the first few years of the web were pretty much video-free ,
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replicate the experiments that are described in print .
500 years ago , it ran into a competitor with a lethal advantage .
it &apos;s the participation age , right ?
they used the same trash to form green manure .
and so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
and in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
so one of the first things we thought we would tackle would be how we go about predicting epidemics .
you could have friendship relationships , sibling relationships , spousal relationships , co-worker relationships , neighbor relationships and the like .
in the dotted red line , we show what the adoption would be in the random people ,
because now , with this idea we can take a random sample of people , have them nominate their friends , those friends would be more central , and we could do this without having to map the network .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
would you get any population-level immunity ?
and collect vast amounts of information about people &apos;s temperature , but from centrally located individuals .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
this is a song that i wrote based on traditional basque rhythms .
so what i did is , i took all this research and i made it into a -- well , basically it &apos;s a product catalog of this one pig , and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag on the back .
and what it is -- it &apos;s actually steak .
and what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart without open heart surgery . and once it &apos;s in the right spot , they remove the outer shell , and the heart valve , well , it gets this shape and at that moment it starts beating , instantly .
this is the grand cafe here in oxford .
kind of signature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments .
so they started to think , &quot; could we build a neonatal incubator that &apos;s built entirely out of automobile parts ? &quot;
he went to a bunch of science labs around the world and videotaped everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this . we should record it . &quot;
and that &apos;s how gps was born .
hiv isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ;
and yet , the reality in resource-poor countries ,
that means doctors and nurses simply don &apos;t have the time to take care of patients .
imagine yourself , if you can , you &apos;re a young woman in africa , you &apos;re going to the hospital or clinic .
we bring mothers who have hiv , who &apos;ve been through these pmtct programs in the very facilities , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team .
we try to bring in the husbands , the partners .
and so the mentor mother went along with .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors ,
our mentor mothers do .
mb : simple solutions to complex problems .
and so , subsequently i participated in every single 46664 event that i could take part in and gave news conferences , interviews , talking and using my platform as a musician , with my commitment to mandela -- out of respect for the tremendous , unbelievable work that he had done .
i &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the last two and a half years --
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv / aids orphans .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
we shift the gravitational center of it .
you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 965 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
reductive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
so , we &apos;re inviting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
let &apos;s move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i urge you to seek out .
i hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
gary wolf : the quantified self
you &apos;re probably familiar with the nike + system .
and the self isn &apos;t the only thing ; it &apos;s not even most things .
yes ?
what &apos;s in that information ?
if we continue through the entire stack , we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron .
or maybe really , really fine capellini with branches .
and indeed , these days i harbor new hopes .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
and this sequence of neural activation is hypothesized to be the neural basis of those sequence of movements .
i mention this because there are prophets today who claim that technology will fundamentally alter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species .
&lt; / doc &gt;
why ?
somebody has to feel how you felt .
we succeeded .
and also -- i think -- without psycho-social therapy , and without considering this in all humanitarian projects , we cannot build-up civil societies .
the women said , &quot; we agree . we &apos;ll use pills , but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills , &quot;
wherever you find people , you &apos;ll find contraceptives in thailand .
and before long , the condom was know as the girl &apos;s best friend .
and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic .
he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .
and this is probably the best thing he &apos;s ever done with his mba .
we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools , because alcohol impairs judgment .
and we believe if you want to help the poor , access to credit must be a human right .
and here is a bamboo building --
i also want to tell you and share with you how my team and i have been using mushrooms over the last three years .
i say far less , because 10 percent isn &apos;t going to cut it .
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production .
a major fortune 500 furniture maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment .
tim jackson : an economic reality check
this is the carbon intensity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
status-driven , conspicuous consumption thrives from the language of novelty . and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is locking economic structure with social logic -- the economic institutions , and who we are as people , locked together to drive an engine of growth .
they want to hunker down , they want to look to the future .
that is a deeply humanizing vision of our lives , and it &apos;s a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model .
and ecosia works in pretty much the same way .
and this too requires investment , investment -- for example , in places -- places where we can connect , places where we can participate , shared spaces , concert halls , gardens , public parks , libraries , museums , quiet centers , places of joy and celebration , places of tranquility and contemplation , sites for the &quot; cultivation of a common citizenship , &quot; in michael sandel &apos;s lovely phrase .
i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , &quot; gdp fell two percent this year . good news !
&lt; speaker &gt; barbara block &lt; / speaker &gt;
some of you may be guilty of having contributed to the demise of bluefin .
we don &apos;t know where the structure is .
what do they like to eat ?
we send this fish back into the sea .
with the help of my former postdoc , gareth lawson , this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna .
these become forthright in places we need to protect .
so in this case , sal &apos;s looking at two tags there ,
so this is just three years of data right here --
a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the golden gate bridge .
and this , with measuring .
how many children did you have ?
it was down here .
this is the average for all of sub-saharan africa .
congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
we had primary school actually started in 1842 .
now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality .
come on . we want everyone down there .
these are the african countries .
imagine , if you will -- a gift .
is there a waiting list ?
there is a funnel , an aerial part , a lamp and clockwork key on the ark .
we have david attenborough .
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time .
this is a serious business .
we have 11 and a half million root apex and a total length of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
they have electrical signals .
and so when i come back from these trips , and i &apos;m thinking about development , and i &apos;m flying home and i &apos;m thinking ,
it &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
in tanzania and uganda , they represent 90 percent of coke &apos;s sales .
now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow .
&quot; wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
but more importantly , it saves lives .
on august 14th and 15th , they took a stool sample , and by the 25th of august , it was confirmed he had type 1 polio .
and we are so close .
there are 300 nurses studying .
the failure points were the same : walls and slabs not tied properly into columns -- that &apos;s a roof slab hanging off the building -- cantilevered structures , or structures that were asymmetric ,
they tied the rebar right ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : natalie jeremijenko &apos;s unusual lab puts art to work , and addresses environmental woes by combining engineering know-how with public art and a team of volunteers . these real-life experiments include : walking tadpoles , texting &quot; fish , &quot; planting fire-hydrant gardens and more .
in this case , of course , the roundabout with that micro-decisions being made in situ by people not being told what to do .
so it starts by building a better mousetrap , of course .
and that aggregating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
this was civic mobilization .
here &apos;s one of them that we have up now .
healthy sub-populations of birds , increasing biodiversity generally .
but they also have a chelating agent in them .
it is the network ;
here &apos;s how the song goes .
i received and email and it said , &quot; hi , i &apos;m ray .
so here &apos;s a series of projects over the last few years where i &apos;ve been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
zf : so what i did was i took those voicemails , and with their permission , converted them to mp3s
like , &quot; phew , it &apos;s not him . &quot;
and i chose two people to be , and i asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on facebook .
and then a few days later i sent her this .
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
i gave of my time and my money ,
but more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories i had heard before .
anyway , another interesting thing happened while i was there .
the fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
second thing that i &apos;ve learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity .
so in short , it &apos;s a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
smile . smile . open the mouths .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to innovate and invent .
if you get a stomach ache , if you get a little bit bloated , was not the right food , was not the right cooking manipulation or maybe other things went wrong .
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechanical means , because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for digestion .
it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even &#91; though &#93; our eight signals would say , &quot; stop , enough .
if we add the matrix , if we add the structure language , which we have to learn , when we learn it , then we can put it back ;
so i actually developed a proposal to go out with a cargo ship and two decommissioned fishing trawlers , a crane , a chipping machine and a cold-molding machine .
whenever possible , refuse single-use and disposable plastics .
they say the print media is dying --
you know , these last two cartoons -- i did them live during a conference in hanoi .
you will not like it .
now , talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two .
i said , &quot; well , maybe we don &apos;t have time for this right now . &quot; &quot; another time . &quot;
and it worked .

and it was that compassion which bothered them ,
can you believe it ?
and therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
and the title of my talk was therefore &quot; indian innovation from gandhi to gandhian engineering . &quot;

one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the focal length of a convex lens .
and currently i &apos;m president of global research alliance ,
now fast forward to 1900 : half the world &apos;s people -- more than half -- still live in asia , but they &apos;re now making only a fifth of the world &apos;s product .
we think in terms of war and interstate war .
the tectonic plates of world politics were shifting .
that will be a measure of total economic size , but not of per capita income -- won &apos;t tell you about the composition of the economy .
many people argue that the 21st century is going to repeat the 20th century ,
all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments , there nobody &apos;s in charge .
so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this , i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration ,
restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean and to encourage its resiliency .
the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
there &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char -- these were the common species .
i get the meat sweats .

what damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inflict on the plant ?
here you see a typical cucumber leaf that turned actually from green to black because of a black fungus , sooty mold , which is covering it .
there is a whole wealth of other natural enemies and this is just the last example .
there are no gmos -- genetically modified organisms -- whatsoever .
but if we go , for example , to this place , southeast israel , the arava area above the great rift valley , where the really top-notch -- the pearl of the israeli agriculture is located , especially under greenhouse conditions , or under screenhouse conditions -- if you drive all the way to eilat , you see this just in the middle of the desert .
and thirdly , also to increase awareness by the growers to the potential of this industry .
i love video games .
now if we look at what &apos;s going on in someone &apos;s head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occurring .
simple game quest .
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time .
so , you give people lots and lots of different tasks .
and two things really flow from this .
and i just want to end by suggesting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world .

most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .
so you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
i guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 1960s , when i was seven or eight years old , watching jacques cousteau documentaries on the living room floor with my mask and flippers on .
but the ocean-protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
the peaks that don &apos;t come out of the water are the seamounts .
we as a world are faced with a problem .
so if the united states removes a million dollars &apos; worth of lobsters from a reef , kiribati gets 50,000 dollars .
they realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community .
and it was a bottom-up system , and that was very important with this work , from the bottom up to secure this .
but in contrast to my evil twin who lusts after world domination , my motives are not sinister .
the more targeted our interventions , the better .
now let &apos;s take a look at these miraculous receivers up close .
so it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity .
and the logic of our experiment was simple .
based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies , this makes perfect sense .

because , when you zoom out that far , you lose the ability to view people as humans .
and ethnic conflicts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat .
the highest level of deaths on the battlefield was recorded between 1998 and 2001 , with about 80,000 soldiers , policemen and rebels killed every year .
but let &apos;s look at the good news again .
rather , local leaders committed to revisiting them later on .
leadership needs to be capable , determined and visionary in its commitment to peace .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : aaron huey &apos;s effort to photograph poverty in america led him to the pine ridge indian reservation , where the struggle of the native lakota people -- appalling , and largely ignored -- compelled him to refocus . five years of work later , his haunting photos intertwine with a shocking history lesson .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain ,
the treaty seemed to be a complete victory for red cloud and the sioux .
that clause was obviously ignored .
with this event , a new era in native american history began .
the infant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u.s. national average .
because for so long i &apos;ve been standing on the sidelines
we all love chocolate .
now , i didn &apos;t come here to depress you about the state of the global supply chain .
this is offshore .
they don &apos;t own those facilities .
you need a place where people can come together , sit down without fear of judgment , without recrimination , to actually face the problem , agree on the problem and come up with solutions .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time i &apos;ve seen the ability , the commitment , the will of government to do this decline , and i don &apos;t see them making a comeback right now .
the numbers just make you want to zone out .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
so let &apos;s do it . so here we go for the first time ever , a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network .
governments realize that it &apos;s a big deal for our economies , but don &apos;t know how to fix it .
figure out your mortgages , being skeptical of government statistics , those kinds of things --
instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four -- conceptualizing problems , applying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .
i still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
but automation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
all backwards .
i can &apos;t think of any other subject where that &apos;s recently been possible .
so one of the roadblocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exams .
and while we &apos;re about it , let &apos;s have a bit of fun , for us , for the students and for ted here .
or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder .
the peacock &apos;s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
it &apos;s hard to grasp , but it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and when i &apos;m on my bike , i feel that i connect with the profound beauty of israel , and i feel that i &apos;m united with this country &apos;s history and biblical law .
and i can &apos;t see myself going into a state prison in new jersey and making such a proposition , but this being israel , the warden somehow made it happen .
well , that &apos;s a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it &apos;s getting dark soon and dangerous .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning underdogs .
and that &apos;s how they develop self-esteem .
and so , perspective and context and history play key roles in the way i plan my rides with the kids .
i ran away .
so if this gentleman had had a holistic education , would he be sitting there ?
there isn &apos;t enough water .
no petrochemicals in the pavement .
the food is incredible .
the green school effect -- we don &apos;t know what it is .
and the balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do , so they use metal scaffolding to build the bamboo building
it &apos;s a place marked on ancient maps as &quot; here be monsters . &quot;
what i &apos;d also like to convey is that it is not all doom and gloom that we are seeing in the high seas .
it &apos;s actually a bay .
so what i &apos;d really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up .
we can stop the collision course of 50 percent of the planet with the high seas .
but i did go on to be a reasonably astute , arguably world-class worrier .
in case you missed it , we &apos;ll look again .
you guys may be familiar with this research that &apos;s coming out of the nfl .
it &apos;s a great place to start if you have questions .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1013 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
we have only been discussing and consumed with high-level preoccupations over troop levels , drawdown timelines , surges and sting operations , when we should be examining the details of where the social fabric has been most torn , where the community has improvised and survived and shown acts of resilience and amazing courage just to keep life going .
we are missing the stories of violet , who , despite surviving genocide in the church massacre , she kept on going on , burying bodies , cleaning homes , cleaning the streets .
not one , but 50 percent .
ideas , language , even the phrase &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot;
however , if you actually talk to people and even question yourself , and you ask yourself , where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?
and before you know it , it &apos;s 5 p.m. ,
i think that sleep and work are very closely related --
which is ridiculous , but that &apos;s one of the excuses that managers give .
now what &apos;s interesting is , if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work , like at home , in the car , on a plane , late at night , or early in the morning , you don &apos;t find managers and meetings . you find a lot of other distractions , but not managers and meetings .
so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting , which leads to another meeting .
and what you &apos;ll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other .
i hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people , to think about laying off a little bit , and giving people more time to get work done .
everything in the kitchen was salvaged .
so we changed that and put , &quot; this is the famous budweiser house .
so i can show you an object you &apos;ve never seen before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives .
the fourth thing is labor is disproportionately more expensive than materials .
now there &apos;s a blight on the planet .
but you know what they did ? they hooked a metaphor into it and said , &quot; i drink dr. pepper ... &quot;
the last thing is gregariousness .
everybody points and laughs , and they say , &quot; he tried it a fifth time and it still didn &apos;t work .
i came here today to talk about what &apos;s wrong with our food system .
they do this because they &apos;ve stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again .
not too long ago , my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal .
the second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six .
it may be one of our most ancient human heritages .
and as the saying goes , when angry , you will make the best speech you will ever regret .
just out of curiosity , how many of you ?
but it &apos;s not just what he stood for , it &apos;s what his message was .
now if i were to come to you face-to-face and come this close to you , you would feel threatened .
&quot; in the name of father ibrahim , let me offer you some food . &quot;
they sit on the floor -- she doesn &apos;t even have a tablecloth .
it was done in northern ireland .
and so who of you ever ate insects ?
and not only in the states , but in any country , in any economy .
you &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
the human population is growing very rapidly
and you can easily do without anything .
if we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure .
on the left-hand side , you see a market in laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
i predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and actually , our product -- what you see here .
then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
especially in africa where t.b. and hiv are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .

the last stage is basically waste ,
right , here &apos;s a reconditioned coffee machine .
a couple of wormeries in there too .
and that &apos;s softly moving that air current through the room .
i mean , the whole thing is is super-sustainable .
and i hope you all take part .
so we decided , a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn &apos;t sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values ,
it &apos;s the female trend , and it &apos;s the sustainability trend , that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come .
from work or from home , they took the day off , and nothing worked in iceland .
&lt; speaker &gt; tony porter &lt; / speaker &gt;
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
now i expected him to say something like , i &apos;d be sad ; i &apos;d be mad ; i &apos;d be angry , or something like that .
they called me anthony growing up as a kid .
she &apos;s what i know today to be mentally ill , higher-functioning at times than others .
we see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
i &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
and the second thing , which has stayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad .
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
i didn &apos;t know how to look at them .
books came from donated schoolbooks .
this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances .
not a lot of women did .
i first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
and basically what you &apos;ll see is what economists talk about as the polarization of the economy .
you would tell everyone below you what to do .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
so who were they ?
now because we haven &apos;t fully processed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways , where you can see that the stereotypes are changing .
there &apos;s no hole in the middle that you &apos;re going to fall through .
it was purchased the year i was born ,
it was theirs . it was experiential . it was authentic .
i teach at the science leadership academy , which is a partnership school between the franklin institute and the school district of philadelphia .
this was done in like two or three days .
we know how to do this better , and it &apos;s time to do better .
and we &apos;ve been surprised to find , as young parents , that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex .
alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- -- and i was there with a catcher &apos;s mitt .
and i think i &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
and i was really surprised by those feelings .
this is actually the last little image we have of him .
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since i participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .
you start to realize that &quot; hey , i could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that i &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and i won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
rg : and so this is what -- and we think that a lot of parents , when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your bags for a trip to europe , and you &apos;re really excited to go .
now before we go on , i have a confession to make .
what i find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our facebook network ,
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
it &apos;s a scheme in the u.k .
it &apos;s amazing that 413 lbs were lost just from the extra exercise .
in other words , i can trust him or her .
we &apos;ve seen over 2,000 kills by these amazing animals .
we called her legadema , which means , &quot; light from the sky . &quot;
dj : and of course , one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles .
dj : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hunting .
and so we , with the national geographic , formed the big cats initiative to march forward into conservation , taking care of the big cats that we loved --
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we condone .
bj / dj : thank you very much .
and i &apos;m in the meeting -- it &apos;s about a three-hour meeting -- and two hours in , there needs to be that bio break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embarrassed .
so i &apos;m not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone .
and carrie says , &quot; boy , i feel like i didn &apos;t really draw out the main point on the hegelian dialectic . &quot;
there &apos;s a really good study that shows this really well .
i learned that i need to keep my hand up . &quot;
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
don &apos;t make decisions too far in advance , particularly ones you &apos;re not even conscious you &apos;re making .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like incarceration in the future .
now judy bonds is a coal miner &apos;s daughter .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;
one problem : waste handling and unemployment .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic stability .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money to come and get here .
so i think what i &apos;ll do is just call you a storyteller . &quot;
so i was very excited about this .
what underpinned this shame , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which , we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blank enough . i &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , promoted enough . &quot;
i have a slight office supply addiction , but that &apos;s another talk . so i had a manila folder , and i had a sharpie , and i was like , what am i going to call this research ?
and it did . i call it a breakdown ; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening .
so she goes like this .
we live in a vulnerable world .
the more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ... to love with our whole hearts , even though there &apos;s no guarantee -- and that &apos;s really hard , and i can tell you as a parent , that &apos;s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; can i love you this much ?
and even as we do our own work , all too often , we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing , or the required thing , or the profitable thing .
why ? because bankers are smart people .
a wise person knows when to bend the rules .
and so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months ,
second , don &apos;t waste your time on kids who can &apos;t pass the test no matter what you do .
if instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures , they will do fewer .
under normal sentencing procedures , judge russell would have had little choice but to sentence pettengill to serious jail-time as a drug felon .
they made sure that their loan recipients were staying up with their payments .
rules and incentives don &apos;t tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good parent , how to be a good spouse , or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer or a good teacher .
because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
since i live on a houseboat on the running stream of lake union , this makes perfect sense to me .
take the fatihah , the seven-verse opening chapter that is the lord &apos;s prayer and the shema yisrael of islam combined .
yet all there is in the original arabic is that one word : houris .
and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative .
and so it brings the second question : why should scientists study creativity ?
this is a short video of how we did this project .
in red is an area that active in the prefrontal cortex , the frontal lobe of the brain ,
he &apos;s in there . you can see his legs up there .
now when i think about improvisation and the language , well what &apos;s next ?
whether or not you like the music is irrelevant .
&lt; speaker &gt; deborah rhodes &lt; / speaker &gt;
now everybody rushed to criticize the task force , even though most of them weren &apos;t in anyway familiar with the mammography studies .
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
but it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
it &apos;s made not of a bulky tube , but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector .
and the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
it &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
of course we should .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1048 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
here &apos;s a picture of me and my friend , chris , on the coast of the pacific ocean .
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer , or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store and you get to be first in line -- even if you were last at the other line , swoop right in there .
i &apos;d love to just talk about each one briefly .
and being aware is just about remembering that you saw everything you &apos;ve seen for the first time once , too . so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a &apos;s . for the closing thought , i want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to canada .
he would say , &quot; look , can you believe they have a mango here from mexico ?
we &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it .
i think of meditation .
it is all of those things .
i don &apos;t believe in the hope of change , unless we take action to make it so . &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
thank you .
now there &apos;s a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthropology .
and he said one day , &quot; what &apos;s the shortest distance between two points ? &quot;
and because of that , you start to dig around for your external memories -- where did you leave them ?
so that &apos;s why i study cyborg anthropology .
and said , &quot; hi , i &apos;m trying to make a toaster .
but luckily , i found a patent online for industrial furnaces that use microwaves ,
and geologists have actually christened -- well , they &apos;re debating whether to christen -- the age that we &apos;re living in -- they &apos;re debating whether to make it a new geological epoch called the anthropocene , the age of man .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and those colored globs are microbes that are actually swimming around in this room right now , all around us .
i &apos;m calling my initiative , &quot; take the other to lunch . &quot;
and since we had established some trust , we believed in each other &apos;s sincerity .
so i &apos;m here to tell you that we have a problem with boys , and it &apos;s a serious problem with boys .
nothing about that prevents us from paying attention to the literacy needs of our boys between ages three and 13 .
but here he stands as testament to the fact that you can &apos;t roughhouse on the playground today .
so that &apos;s the first reason : zero tolerance policies and the way they &apos;re lived out .
and if you ask title 1 teachers , they &apos;ll tell you they &apos;ve got about four or five boys for every girl that &apos;s in their program , in the elementary grades .
they don &apos;t have the depth , the rich narrative that really engaging video games have , that the boys are really interested in .
it &apos;s very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language .
it &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
more overt , the burden of proving that a practice is safe should not be placed on the public that would be harmed , but rather on the industry that stands to profit .
all of the time .
it is this underlying assumption of limitlessness that makes it possible to take the reckless risks that we do .
so that means drilling for oil in the deepest water , including the icy arctic seas , where a clean-up may simply be impossible .
the problem is that our master-narrative has an answer for that too .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1055 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
i come from colorado .
the pump was a little bit problematic when performing , so i &apos;d attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage .
i fell through my apartment door and crawled to the bathroom
i finally decided it was time to take my doctor &apos;s advice .
so my doctor got the ent , the top guy at the clinic , to come down and give me surgery to move the tubes around my voice box .
&#91; singing : french &#93; thank you .
it shortens the lives of the people who live there in the gulf .
we feel so good about ourselves .
but guess what ?
but if we want to make something hard , we come up , &quot; i know , i &apos;m going to make a hard substance .
we are passionate about rescuing some dead materials from the landfill , but sometimes not as passionate about rescuing living beings , living people .

so this is where this little dear comes into play . this is my daughter .
that &apos;s where those artifacts are coming from .
you can really see the details of the data set . it &apos;s very high-resolution ,
it really just works like a huge iphone .
so just looking at this heart , i can play back a video here .
these visualizations are brand new .
i can look inside of it .
some of the greatest innovations and developments in the world often happen at the intersection of two fields .
it &apos;s just a robot .
he does not seem to be breathing .
there &apos;s a lot more to come .
now , i know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the west that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
what we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
well , basically the east was swallowed by the west .
the problem with this proposition is that the chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the chinese than is true with any western state .
and the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with --
what is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
so this is a solution to a situation where china &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
even doctors are patients at some point .
so i &apos;m going to talk about one experiment that a few dentists in connecticut cooked up about 30 years ago .
so the upshot was this . the upshot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all .
that path , that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change .
and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
you ask tufte , and he would say , &quot; yes , this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible . &quot;
so that &apos;s our general blood work test .
last year , they made profits of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respectively .
i &apos;ve been talking today about latent information , all this information that exists in the system that we &apos;re not putting to use .
and i just ate it up .
and then also my family was in chaos ,
and i think , i truly believe , that we can change this thing one laugh at a time .
so now i want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war , and that is the eastern oyster .
and one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day .
you can see in the diagram how it grows over time from an infrastructural space into a new public urban space .
but we imagine , with our calculations , that by 2050 , you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster .
apparently it can .
you know what those are , right ?
it was not something you &apos;d even remark upon .
but he also moved here to meet other people doing what he &apos;s doing .
and there are industrial versions of this -- about 20,000 dollars .
well he did a little bit better than free .
and so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics .
they can make some educated guesses .
why should i know this ?
she &apos;s 37 years old , she hasn &apos;t won a marathon of any kind in eight years , and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth .
when you have two outliers in one organism , it &apos;s not a coincidence .
australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain .
the uterus would fall out , literally fall out of the body .
maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal .
you can &apos;t be hauling all your crap around , trying to chase the antelope .
that &apos;s because an apache triathlon used to be you &apos;d run 50 miles across the desert , engage in hand-to-hand combat , steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home .
i &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
i will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide .
so i am going to read a poem that was chosen just now .
i think now i never was pure .
precipice running to and running from human beings .
i &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
if you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
meditate for half an hour .
because people say , &quot; bloody hell mate , i haven &apos;t got time to get fit . you want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot;
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 228293 &quot; &gt; sebastian betti &lt; / reviewer &gt;
scientist : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
where it &apos;s actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality .
the remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group
i could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays with their granddaughters , with their friends , and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house , like sharing a bedtime story .
one case was the robot you saw there , autom .
so here &apos;s the first exploration of this idea , where characters can be physical or virtual , and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back .
but i can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
dm : every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
we can do everything .
maybe i should become an historian , or maybe a reporter .
they do everything for them .
the nearest we &apos;ve come is with aramid fiber .
and to do that we had to find an alternative to glass , which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes .
and in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food , cardboard and plastic waste .
so the final project i want to talk about is the sahara forest project , which we &apos;re working on at the moment .
so inside it &apos;s cool and humid , which means the plants need less water to grow .
some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts .
and this is an important point .
and they had some , in my opinion , terrible christmas music .
so what happened now is i &apos;m standing here in rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i &apos;m talking about whistling .
oh , hah .
and i hope you &apos;ll come with me on my basic premise that words matter , that they shape the way we understand ourselves , the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others .
and as they do that , they cultivate what they call &quot; curiosity without assumptions . &quot;
this is jean vanier .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us .
and by the look of that paunch , he hasn &apos;t been doing enough yoga .
so i will paraphrase einstein in closing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race .
babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven , and then there &apos;s a systematic decline .
the first is that the babies are listening intently to us , and they &apos;re taking statistics as they listen to us talk --
what we did was expose american babies during this period to mandarin .
she &apos;s a six-monther .
and everywhere i &apos;m finding that i hear similar themes .
what is the cost of not trying ?
and one woman stood there with this perfect carriage , her hands at her side , and she talked about the reunion of the 30 after the war
but that maybe it &apos;s not monsters so much , but the broken parts of ourselves , sadnesses , secret shame ,
and they wanted to celebrate what &apos;s beautiful about kibera and mathare -- the photojournalists and the creatives , the graffiti artists , the teachers and the entrepreneurs .
for two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend ,
who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states .
and he said , &quot; so i conclude that , in many ways , leadership is like a panicle of rice .
and so it &apos;s the pursuit of better things , easily shared .
our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are gps-enabled and web-enabled -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
but they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
and honestly , it &apos;s full of surprises .
the crafty fox is this woman who &apos;s into crafts ,
and it grows on a very regular daily basis .
so that &apos;s how it all started .
so it evolved .
and i really dedicated myself to that , both at the u.n. and then as secretary of state .
but there &apos;s still so much violence , still so many problems , and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables .
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
in washington , the president of the united states is sitting in the oval office , assessing whether or not to strike al qaeda in yemen .
did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself , you &apos;re statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you ?
but it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening .
taking right-angled bends here and there , having thin areas like the eyelids , thick areas like the cheek , different colors .
actually , sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed .
people know now that i &apos;m enthusiastic , that i &apos;m a happy person . &quot; and that &apos;s the change that can be achieved for teenagers .
this is a man in his 20s
they &apos;re people who have their face shot off .
would we be happy if our doctor &apos;s face , our lawyer &apos;s face , our financial adviser &apos;s face was covered ?
we then put bone and tissue from the back .
i can put it in place where it &apos;s meant to be .
we &apos;re watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides .
these words , i hold onto all my life .
their achievements , intellectually and scientifically , are extraordinary , and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms .
and this is what he said : &quot; the island is the canoe ; the canoe , the island . &quot;
and in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body ,
it &apos;s the one theory that the biologists ever really got right .
just like genome mixes the study of all the genes , proteomics is the study of all the proteins .
and so i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot;
but we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it .
and it &apos;s miraculous in the case of infectious disease -- how well it works .
and it sounds silly , but that &apos;s basically what we do .
but design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health -- guide your body back to health .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , wasn &apos;t the most popular thing in the classical music world .
and for a moment i was wondering , are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground , a change that does not come through foreign intervention , through the misery of occupation , through nations invading our land and deepening the sense of inferiority sometimes ?
this is what they were telling . this is their propaganda .
and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , tolerant to the outside .
if you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide .
we have covered a lot of tragedies , a lot of problems , a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spots in the region , because we were centered at the middle of it .
thank you so much .
could art change the world ?
and then i saw it -- could it be possible ? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting i &apos;d done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there .
i decided to paste in eight israeli and palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall .
and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; so can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
three kids -- that was three students -- were &#91; detained &#93; by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
you see that enough in the media .
some people question , &quot; why is it in black and white ?
okay , india .
for example , we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get .
that &apos;s rio .
and this starts right now .
everyone has done something .
platforms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the impression that , &quot; wow , i &apos;m not alone .
he was a middle-class guy .
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
the next day i was in tahrir .
the winning here is not the whole details of what &apos;s going to happen in the political scene .
most education funding -- whether it &apos;s k through 12 , or the great universities or community colleges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state budgets .
how could you have a problem like this ?
they sell off the revenues from tobacco .
technology has a role to play .
i &apos;m going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture .
thank you .
the first author , alexis carrel , a nobel prize winner .
this is actually a patient who &#91; was &#93; presented with a deceased organ ,
we actually take a very small piece of the bladder from the patient -- less than half the size of a postage stamp .
that was all new bone that was implanted using these techniques .
it takes about seven hours to print a kidney , so this is about three hours into it now .
i was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
lm : most of my professors were all for it , and they said , &quot; bring pictures and show me the clips online , &quot; and &quot; i &apos;m happy for you . &quot;
so while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons , i was watching very esoteric documentaries made by and about women .
so race , class , gender , ability , all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman .
thank you .
i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .
but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work .
a galaxy . hey ! there &apos;s another galaxy . oh , look ! there &apos;s another galaxy .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it ,
but i was excited , so i kept going .
we &apos;re a not-for-profit --
do it as long as necessary , until you have mastery .
and so what i &apos;m showing you here , this is data from a pilot in the los altos school district ,
the inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
so once again , using technology , not just flipping the classroom , you &apos;re humanizing the classroom , i &apos;d argue , by a factor of five or 10 .
once again , i didn &apos;t expect it to be used in classrooms .
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
it gives us a little bit of justin bieber and a little bit of afghanistan .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
so you &apos;re looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made .
he was an early talker . and so we started to analyze why .
my son is leaving red ink . i am leaving green ink .
so we &apos;re using these structures to start predicting the order of language acquisition , and that &apos;s ongoing work now .
and if you put them on one plain , a second plain is where the content lives .
so , to summarize , the idea is this : as our world becomes increasingly instrumented and we have the capabilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they &apos;re saying it in , what &apos;s emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynamics that have previously not been seen .
can you do it ?
they &apos;re the veins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty veins .
there &apos;s a disincentive to conserve , because , if you don &apos;t use your water right , you can lose your water right .
after all , it is their water right , and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream , it &apos;s their right to do so .
we &apos;ve connected senior water rights holders with brewers in montana , with hotels and tea companies in oregon and with high-tech companies that use a lot of water in the southwest .
and he &apos;s going into a diner .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
and then when they get old , they haven &apos;t really developed a philosophy of life , but they &apos;ve decided , &quot; i &apos;ve been successful at everything ; i &apos;m just not going to die . &quot;
and so reading and educating your emotions is one of the central activities of wisdom .
what it really takes to do well , to lead a meaningful life , are things that are deeper , things we don &apos;t really even have words for .
this is a gender-linked trait , by the way .
and this is not an ability ; it &apos;s a drive and a motivation .

but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
he thought nature would protect us from their formation .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
if it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too quiet .
in this hubble image , we see two galaxies .
it &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
there &apos;s a beautiful statement on the screen that says , &quot; light creates ambiance , light makes the feel of a space , and light is also the expression of structure . &quot;
as you can see here , there &apos;s some direct light on the floor , but they could easily figure out where that comes from .
to me , it is something from theater ,
and by modulating the amount of blue in our environment , we can help people to relax , or to be alert , to fall asleep , or to stay awake .
how do they share their culture ?
we can go further .
edward hopper was a real master in creating the narration by working with light and dark .
and i &apos;m going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say , &quot; oh , i know that like the back of my hand . &quot;
it can crumble so easily , but don &apos;t be afraid to stick your tongue out and taste it .
okay , so these are three things i know to be true .
never mind the fact that i was 14 . they told me , &quot; write about being 14 . &quot;
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , i &apos;m ready to catch them .
i wondered whether i &apos;d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not .
it &apos;s what i strive for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : what was the greatest invention of the industrial revolution ? hans rosling makes the case for the washing machine . with newly designed graphics from gapminder , rosling shows us the magic that pops up when economic growth and electricity turn a boring wash day into an intellectual day of reading .
and they live below the poverty line .
but when i lecture to environmentally-concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines . &quot;
first , population growth .
but i can assure you that this woman in the favela in rio , she wants a washing machine .
&lt; / doc &gt;
this is a beefalo .
and by the way , the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that &apos;s a bioluminescent gene from coral , while this is from jellyfish .
and then , finally , the first cloned piglets : alexis , chista , carrel , janie and dotcom .
these goliath beetles are wired in their wings .
he took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .
it confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now .
so i closed my eyes , i took breath and the first thing that came up and out was &quot; summertime , &quot; porgy and bess .
it &apos;s &quot; aria , &quot; of john cage .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
but if you &apos;re not a native speaker , you have to pass a test .
if you think about the islamic golden age ,
but they are prohibitive to so many millions of poor people .
and she was the best in the class at those subjects .
basil jones : but actually we &apos;re going to start this evolution with a hyena .
ak : it has ears that move passively when the head goes .
a play about early 20th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the national theatre in london .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
come here . stand here where people can see you .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the breath .
mikey brett , craig , leo , zem joaquin and basil and me .
yet i still hadn &apos;t saved a single life .
this is four billion hours wasted in this country alone .
and i left the room and said , &quot; no way . &quot;
britlin was so innocent and so sweet , and her voice was so pure .
and from the crowd emerged this young man , scott haines .

we can actually then light things up .
we &apos;ve had a mom in utah who used them with her kids , to a science researcher in the u.k. ,
and it &apos;s painful enough now -- and i think it &apos;s designed this way -- it &apos;s painful enough so you want to jump .
you do that because , 27 years before , an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .
and i realized that , if they had to go into combat , they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .
they put a big screen up , and they take you through everything :
you probably think that the force that i led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
perhaps something very naughty .
it &apos;s a company that thrives on idealism .
so it turns out that google is a compassionate company , because googlers found compassion to be fun .
it &apos;s like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own coworkers ?
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
i found this to be true , both on the individual level and at a corporate level .
and i took that driving lesson , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to learn how to drive . &quot;
so just like johnny cash &apos;s sue , a boy given a girl &apos;s name , i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away .
and i &apos;m in one of the most competitive environments in the world , where you work hard , play hard , you gotta be the best , you gotta be the best .
but before i got to him , i was so lost .
and i went home , and , because the pain in my chest ached so much , i thought , &quot; i &apos;ll go out for a run . &quot;
do something different . what do you want to be ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t speak hindi . i &apos;d never been to india . hadn &apos;t a clue .
and i got my way here being happily proud that i couldn &apos;t see .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : jackson browne plays a song about being on the ocean ... or really , being anywhere among passionate friends . &quot; if i could be anywhere , &quot; he sings , &quot; anywhere right now , i would be here . &quot;
in fact , this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics , the second law of thermodynamics , or the law of entropy .
you have to survey the whole history of the universe .
they &apos;re really a sort of cosmic mush .
the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile , significantly more vulnerable ,
so at those deep oceanic vents , fantastic chemistry began to happen ,
and occasionally , there are disasters .
i call this ability collective learning .
if we avoid that trap , others are waiting for us .
it &apos;s a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what &apos;s happening .
then you get to their political articles .
political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics .

and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a forger .
these are real !
he was mostly interested in ink bleaching .
but demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents .
in order to write the book , i asked my sister questions . i wanted to know who my father was , who was the father she had known .
there , just once , it happened in may of 1968 .
roger ebert : remaking my voice
i was using my ipod to play the leonard cohen song &apos; i &apos;m your man &apos; for my doctors and nurses .
it knew things like the difference between an exclamation point and a question mark .
so i sent them many hours of recordings of my voice , including several audio commentary tracks that i &apos;d made for movies on dvds .
many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves .
this was a computer-assisted instruction system , which in those days ran on a computer named illiac .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
excuse me .
re : wait . i have one more thing to add .
so let me tell you a story .
that &apos;s not only in the developing world .
but perhaps the most challenging part was to convince the regulators -- a matter which was debated in the parliament -- that a young female surgeon be allowed the opportunity to pioneer for her country .
and then transport these organs to the recipient hospital and then graft the gift of life to a recipient the same afternoon .
embryonic stem cells have occupied center stage , chiefly because of their pluripotency -- that is their ease in differentiating into a variety of different cell types .
and i had my vision restored , but not before a prolonged period of convalescence -- three months -- in a head down position .
each one has his story .
and back here in the united states , we saw economic despair , deprivation .
can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers ?
let me help you with some things that you might be thinking .
you see people struggling to get by .
once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly , pain and sorrow .
and you know that . americans don &apos;t read about this guy .
so people all over the middle east , not just in your country , are protesting .
so these guys , you see them .
so everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
now follow me on this , because i &apos;m taking a big risk here .
you &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fiber of your being .
&lt; speaker &gt; kathryn schulz &lt; / speaker &gt;
we go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
he just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
so we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
i &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
no offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
it feels like i &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot; it &apos;s a true feeling .
it could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for .
and the strange thing is , when i watch the film -- i have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- i saw myself literally disappear .
there are many people on this stage right now .
that &apos;s not all .
see , mr. hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
we were all upset with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend brennan .
and we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest adventures human beings have embarked upon ,
so if you look at this pie chart , 96 percent of the universe , at this point in our exploration of it , is unknown or not well understood .
and what the russians are doing is they &apos;re building these detectors and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light .
i can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called the extremely large telescope .
that &apos;s an american c-17 cargo plane that flew us from new zealand to mcmurdo in antarctica .
here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1132 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and it &apos;ll depend on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we &apos;re willing to accept the risk of theft .
a lot of good experiments in this .
and there &apos;s some basic innumeracy going on .
enough real world examples helps .
you don &apos;t need a model .
a lot of models come from science .
and those two things made the risk more than it was .
all examples of models changing .
i mean , this works as long as it &apos;s to correct others .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
so it &apos;s important for us , those of us who design security , who look at security policy , or even look at public policy in ways that affect security . it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
and so , going back to this abalone shell , besides being nano-structured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female abalone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; this is how to build an exquisite material .
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
so i stayed up at night , and i talked to my husband ,
and so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales .
my students promised me it would work .
it &apos;s called &quot; our choice &quot; and the author is al gore .
we can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power . this is one of my favorites .
&lt; / doc &gt;
well i took one year .
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium .
you can play around with it .
and this is the pump .
there have been six major research papers on this .
we made 30,000 .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
and what you can do is just , if you give it a twirl ,
and the third night , he would give it two more folds -- and this is a very , very famous cap . if you &apos;ve seen any of our bollywood films ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : phyllis rodriguez and aicha el-wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss . rodriguez &apos; son was killed in the world trade center attacks on september 11 , 2001 ; el-wafi &apos;s son zacarias moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence . in hoping to find peace , these two moms have come to understand and respect one another .
aicha el-wafi : good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
i talk against violence , against terrorism .
and i feel that we have a special connection , which i value very much .
over time , these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface .
so i spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing , and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels , possibly even replacement bone tissue .

you might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
a high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , &quot; surely , &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;
meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us .
but if you &apos;re boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
this scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
my bold speculation is that i will be absolutely vindicated by history .
it reminds us that we are a part of nature , and we &apos;re not separate from it .
and always take time to smell the flowers , and let it fill you with beauty , and rediscover that sense of wonder .
i don &apos;t know why national geographic has done this , they &apos;ve never done this before , but they &apos;re allowing me to show you a few images from a coverage that i &apos;ve just completed that is not published yet .

floating in the open ocean where the ice has melted out .
here &apos;s me in my office .
and now its biggest threat is the disappearance of ice in the north because of the lives that we &apos;re leading in the south .
and they &apos;re also curiously aggressive .
so i had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but i had such , such dry mouth .

and so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber .
so let me see .
or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk led tattoos .
so we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers , i decided instead to embark on a journey of real science , to find a more useful truth .
a recent study at uppsala university in sweden found that it &apos;s very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles .
a recent study at penn state university found that when you smile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more likable and courteous , but you actually appear to be more competent .
he was brash , irreverent -- he was full of macho , a kind of macho one-upmanship .
and without skipping a beat at all , he said , &quot; well , they &apos;d be about the same .
he really popped their balloon .
and he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .
the only way it worked is when the helium atoms were very , very far apart .
the only problem was that feynman diagrams are complicated .
but how should we honor feynman ?
let &apos;s make it concrete .
now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders ,
that you can use to activate , in animal models for example , in pre-clinical studies , these neurons and to see what they do .
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
and then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen .
if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they &apos;re embedded .
are the cells going to tolerate it ? will the immune system react ?
it &apos;s a six-arm maze . and there &apos;s a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move , or he &apos;ll just sit there .
je : which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code .
and this influenced me .
and so we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work .
it has a child running through a field , or something like that .
we won the competition , and it was painful to get there .
so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
so that , even if you &apos;re partially-sighted , that it was kind of crunchy and soft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
so if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .

in fact , what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally , vertically , up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells .
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words ,
it &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
this is a golden coral , a bush .
it &apos;s a green saber of light .

now i know that seems ludicrous .
pull the knot .
you see san francisco and los angeles start to make their journeys down to hawaii in the lower left-hand corner .
and it had a live feed with a 24-hour offset , so you could see the changing relationship and some demographic info coming through at &amp; amp ; t &apos;s data and revealing itself .
so i created this drawing tool .
sheep were the first animal to be raised from mechanically processed byproducts , the first to be selectively bred for production traits , the first animal to be cloned .
you see some people did beautiful stipple renderings , like this one on top -- spent a long time making realistic versions .

this disease was terrifying .
and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
so we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
and then , by 1999 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept .
umar was paralyzed for life .
which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
so that very soon every child , every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever .
bg : well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
our artists are at risk .
so in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ideology of the country .
that iran was once a secular society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was stolen from us by the american government , by the british government .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an iranian woman and an iranian artist , even if i have to operate in the west only for now .
and i had to pay , order and eat at the male section .
maybe it &apos;s a middle eastern culture that became confused with islam .
until very recently we used to have what i call secularism police ,
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be loyal to it .
and in place of that , what happens is that islamism grows as an ideology which is authoritarian , which is quite strident , which is quite anti-western ,
turkey has never been colonized , so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire .
we are muslim believers , but we want to be living as free people in free societies . &quot;
a blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
we have perception , computation and non-visual interfaces .
and because you cannot see the vibration , we actually put red led &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
he &apos;s coming up to the grandstand , fellow federationists .
or for the blind , everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting , in the office setting .
you can see , there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there .
if i look at my own life ,
for which it would be helpful to know what it is that i actually do like to do .
in this case , &quot; keeping a diary supports personal development &quot; --
that &apos;s the kind of power i feel in this room .
we gather together these physicists in los alamos to see what they &apos;ll build .
mill .
you were sleeping during that class .
what if there are truths about justice , and you could just look around in this world and see which things participated , partook of that form of justice ?
the three people who voted for mill before are familiar with this .
he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should guide our conduct ,
it arises from not thinking . &quot;
find an artist or a writer -- or , heaven forbid , find a philosopher and talk to them .
it is up to us to figure out what to do ,
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
and i guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg , or something like that ,
and then we started the hell creek project .
but we thought maybe -- well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .
so this is our problem , as you can imagine .
i guess we could make a glow chicken .
archaeopteryx , which is a bird , a primitive bird , still has that very primitive hand .
thank you .
my first satisfying sculpture was made in collaboration with these fishermen .
so we had to create one .
the sculpture could now be entirely soft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabric of the city .

what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
where you can pee on a little chip connected to your iphone and check yourself for an std .
oh , we might have missed it , but using a.i. on top of radiology , we can find lesions that were missed before .
and these are being augmented even by our devices again today .
probably in a few years , you &apos;ll check into your mirror and it &apos;s going to be diagnosing you .
and i think by leveraging these sorts of technologies , we &apos;re going to change the definition of disability to in some cases be superability , or super-enabling .
in fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .
geomedicine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been exposed to , can dramatically affect your health .
we &apos;re now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as targets and go for the long-term cure .
so in close , as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine , we &apos;re entering an era of miniaturization , decentralization and personalization .
for example , social factors .
it &apos;s not a conspiracy i have got against bulgaria . these are facts .
i can &apos;t tell you how many times i &apos;ve been scolded in the park for letting my kids play on the ground .
and they said , &quot; ha . there won &apos;t be a single moment in the schedule . &quot;
play : our brains are hardwired for play .
really cool term : neoteny -- the retention of play and juvenile traits in adults .
imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dancing , without soccer , without football , without laughter .
he &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groove , he &apos;s in the flow .
we had marginal profit -- i did .
you &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going to trust you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
and &quot; beatjazzers &quot; become as common as d.j. &apos; s .
when composers write music for me , i ask them to forget what they know about the cello .
so my artistic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful noises emitted by the magnificent celestial objects that make up our universe .
it was a solar wind interacting with our ionosphere that he was listening to --

and you just disguise my violence .
so what did they do ?

&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1180 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
so what were these used for ?
and furthermore , we don &apos;t even know what language they spoke .
and so they had to cram the sign .
so we could deliberately erase some symbols , and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols .
and interestingly , we also find the dna sequence from the human genome and instrumental music .
why is that the case ?
you could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf -- and that &apos;s &quot; belief , &quot; right .
today , we can write a word such as ted in egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script , because both of these were deciphered in the 19th century .
and it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
because with that beautiful photo , maybe i can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time .
most of the time is kind of sitting there .
like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
and the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
these are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done
if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture , you can see that there are actually some patterning there , which is three-dimensional .
i don &apos;t know what a dead horse actually smells like , but this one probably smells pretty much like it .
now wouldn &apos;t you know it , there &apos;s some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature .
and i love the idea of something hidden .
this is a police photo . that &apos;s actually my car .
it &apos;s a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create , and it &apos;s the first known expression of art on the planet .
if you look at some of these other items -- concussions .
neurological damage , 10 years of rehab , requires a long-term perspective .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and neck pain is through muscular-skeletal imbalance .
using this technology , the specialists at ucla medical center were able to identify where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring .
a radio device is controlling every step i take ,
simon lewis : i knew when i was timing this that there wouldn &apos;t be time for me to do anything about -- well this is it . this is the control unit .
because the first generation is exoskeletal , it &apos;s wrapped around the leg , around the affected limb .
rebecca mackinnon : so the underlying message of this video remains very powerful even today .
and one activist actually found a contract from a western company for the sale of surveillance technology to the egyptian security forces .
now in china , you have the &quot; great firewall , &quot; as it &apos;s well-known , that blocks facebook and twitter and now google + and many of the other overseas websites .
how do you hold the sovereigns of cyberspace accountable to the public interest when most ceo &apos;s argue that their main obligation is to maximize shareholder profit ?
each and every one of us has a vital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world &apos;s people and not the other way around .
how i define the age of behavior is a period of transnational allegiances , where identity is defined more so by ideas and narratives .
i learned how to use email from the extremist organization that i used .
as an american citizen , ethnically a yemeni , in hiding currently in yemen , who inspired a nigerian , son of the head of nigeria &apos;s national bank .
there is no equivalent of the al-qaeda , without the terrorism , for democracy across muslim-majority societies .
when talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain preconceptions .
but to get to that stage , where democracy builds the fabric of society and the political choices within that fabric , but are certainly not theocratic and military dictatorship -- i.e. you &apos;re voting in a democracy , in an existing democracy , and that democracy is not merely one of the choices at the ballot box . to get to that stage , we genuinely need to start building demand
tim harford : trial , error and the god complex
he gives half of them vitamin c. he gives half of them vitamin b12 .
and doctors suffer from the god complex a lot .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
we clearly can .
it turns out to be very important .
it &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
we &apos;ll get rid of the ones that don &apos;t . &quot; --
shut it down at once . &quot;
but it was always a conjecture .
so many people are there .
na : well , let me first warn you that i &apos;m not the traditional yemeni girl .
it was very hard , you know , to impose my authority .
so the other face of yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil ,
it &apos;s very important for you to go to yementimes.com , and it &apos;s very important to listen to our voice .
we may not be that many , but if we are promoted as a good , positive example , there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again , coming to the bridge -- between yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion .
i &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
and i knocked on the door .
today , they are no longer being written by hobbyists and teenagers .
and that &apos;s the name of the owner of the card .
using the fact that we don &apos;t have the capability to globally police operations like this .
so obviously i googled for it .
and even if we are able to find online criminals , quite often there is no outcome .
think about all the services we have online .
and the journey to that place of understanding and acceptance has been an interesting one for me , and it &apos;s given me an insight into the whole notion of self ,
my dad is white from cornwall , and my mom is black from zimbabwe .
i could be in the movement in a way that i wasn &apos;t able to be in my real life , in myself .
my desire to disappear was still very powerful .
i always wondered why i could feel others &apos; pain so deeply , why i could recognize the somebody in the nobody .
let &apos;s not be freaked out by our bountiful nothingness .
and it &apos;s with those teeth that i want to propose today that we rethink a little bit about the role of contemporary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
and i said , &quot; oh . &quot;
and we &apos;ve lost the sense of what &apos;s actually happening in this world that we &apos;ve made .
but the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects pragmatic chaos has .
and it uses what &apos;s called a bin-packing algorithm .
these guys down on wall street , marco polo and cherokee nation , they &apos;re eight microseconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hollowed out up around the carrier hotel .

in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will invite back al-qaeda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
today , there are 14 health clinics in that area alone .
so the idea that we deployed the troops to respond to the taliban insurgency is mistaken .
they &apos;re worried , in other words , that if anybody believes that it wasn &apos;t such a threat -- oxfam , save the children wouldn &apos;t get the money to build their hospitals and schools .
this doesn &apos;t mean that intervention around the world is a disaster .
this doesn &apos;t mean that afghanistan doesn &apos;t matter , but that it &apos;s one of 40 countries in the world with which we need to engage .

so here &apos;s the problem : this is what we all want .
that is , you ask any generic question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many branches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flowing through each branch , what is the size of the canopy , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
very , very bad for economies and companies and cities in our present paradigm .
there is an extraordinary regularity .
there is an economy of scale .
what is the reason for this ?
and it &apos;s destined to collapse for many reasons -- kind of malthusian reasons -- that you run out of resources .
that &apos;s what we like , hockey sticks .
hitler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any .
according to his biographer , &quot; he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot;
would you eat this ?
but how attractive you find them , how sexually or romantically moved you are by them , rests critically on who you think you &apos;re looking at .
the golf clubs were owned by john f. kennedy and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction .
that &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , i &apos;m a snob and want to boast about having an original .
the question is : how much would people like joshua bell , the music of joshua bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to joshua bell ?
the first shock is recorded as very painful .
because one cup of food a day changes fabian &apos;s life completely .
but it never struck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nurse her baby , and she had no milk to nurse .
and we can see brain volumes up to 40 percent less in these children .
and this is made with chickpeas , dried milk and a host of vitamins , matched to exactly what the brain needs .
or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week -- it costs about 50 cents -- will keep a girl in school , and they &apos;ll give birth to a healthier child , because the malnutrition is sent generation to generation .
we &apos;re seeing that now in the horn of africa where food prices are up 240 percent in some areas over last year .
and they require that a third of that food come from the smallest farmers who would have no opportunity .
and we want to tell our grandchildren that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stunted , but that exists no more .
these filters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to .
and the art of conversation is being replaced -- dangerously , i think -- by personal broadcasting .
it &apos;s about enjoying mundane sounds .
now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
so what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to facebook after you die .
harald haas : wireless data from every light bulb
then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent .
i compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum .
what we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb .
but let me do this .
you need to see what to do .
cars have led-based headlights , led-based back lights ,
i &apos;m talking about your language , of course , because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else &apos;s mind ,
now the reason the chimpanzees don &apos;t do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning .
and this cumulative cultural adaptation , as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others .
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn &apos;t have before we acquired it .
and it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile .
and that question is whether in this modern , globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows .
and we also sampled the outdoor air .
thank you .
i never had babies because heads cannot give birth .
i heard people murmur from time to time that i should love my body , so i learned how to do this .
and i heard stories that shattered all the other stories .
now i make a daily pilgrimage to visit a particular weeping willow by the seine , and i hunger for the green fields in the bush outside bukavu .
and the other women arrived and they sat in a circle , and michaela bathed my head with the sacred water .
it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for , because i know this struggle isn &apos;t my own .
two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys .
drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it &apos;s getting heavier because we &apos;re understanding that we need to do more than we are .
we go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be heated with a furnace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .

the local seabird rescue center , named sanccob , immediately launched a massive rescue operation ,
so the day after we arrived , two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two .
and luckily , the day they arrived , it was .
so what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins ?
and the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .
maybe i could become a filmmaker .
and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad &apos;s favorite number .
and that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
and it was an incredibly thing , working with the u.n .
the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
and unicef , god bless them , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll have a go . &quot;
so these guys were absolutely crucial .
and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , &quot; look , you guys made this possible . and thank you very much . &quot;
we &apos;ve got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce .
it &apos;s all about partnerships .
there we go .

what would happen then ? &quot;
another group that i thought their performance would be very low ,
and that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
and the genetic information is contained in the form of a sequence of four bases abbreviated with the letters a , t , c and g .
this is surprising , of course , because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa .
maybe a single individual is misclassified or so .
and this then , in conjunction with these methods that allow very many dna molecules to be sequenced very rapidly , allowed us last year to present the first version of the neanderthal genome ,
a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
they spread across africa also , of course , and there were older , earlier forms of humans there .
but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .

and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
he &apos;s going down the path .
and the anthropologist randall white has made a very interesting observation : that if our ancestors 40,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they wouldn &apos;t have really understood it .
and there was a very healthy sense of caution , reflected in the tree of knowledge , in pandora &apos;s box , and especially in the myth of prometheus that &apos;s been so important in recent metaphors about technology .
the paige typesetter had 18,000 parts .
they were working on it independently , and they weren &apos;t getting anywhere .
unfortunately , our ability to model their long-term behavior , which has also been increasing , has been increasing only arithmetically .
and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .
so this is a start .
now if we answer those questions in reverse order ,
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
but what else is life characterized by ?
the other thing we need to think about is the emergence of chemical complexity .
so these things together give us evolution , perhaps .
does evolution control the sophistication of matter in the universe ?
they &apos;re inanimate , they &apos;re not alive .
because the thing is , we are so chauvinistic to biology ,
you can burst bubbles .

the picture there is khrushchev .
if i were to ask you , &quot; which are the two asian countries ?
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
dynamically , it has changed over time to become less authoritarian and more democratic .
in fact , if you compare india with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceleration of indian growth -- now india is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , india was ranked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging economies .
we are anonymous . we are legion .

well , i say nothing , but actually there is one teeny weeny little research unit in turin , italy called the hackers profiling project .
and if they did , he then passed on the money to the vendor and the stolen credit card details to the purchaser .
at 13 , with only little english and being bullied at school , he escaped into a world of computers where he showed great technical ability ,
he also had the most effective virtual private network security arrangement the police have ever encountered amongst global cybercriminals .
chris anderson : okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot misha .

richard resnick : welcome to the genomic revolution
the price of a base , to sequence a base , has fallen 100 million times .
then he compared those two genomes in software , and what he found , among other things , in a particular gene called tp53 .

the story begins in 1996 when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here of a tasmanian devil with a large tumor on its face .
which is spread by a virus ,
this is jonas .
we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor , get into the saliva .
so we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .

so for women , housework prevents breast cancer , but for men , shopping could make you impotent .
which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
so for a whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political and cultural reasons , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles .
it &apos;s not just about taking a pill , and your performance and your pain getting better .
which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision .
we need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective .
unfortunately , it turned out , that many of these trials were withheld .
so it &apos;s a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : yang lan , a journalist and entrepreneur who &apos;s been called &quot; the oprah of china , &quot; offers insight into the next generation of young chinese citizens -- urban , connected and alert to injustice .

how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
so through microblogging , we are able to understand chinese youth even better .
last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern oem manufacturing compound in china : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .

can we measure this type of life ?
that is also very robust -- what you find in systems like earth where there are amino acids , but there is no life .
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little experiment that we did .
and if you can do that , then you have life .
three times .
we &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .

it was a really extraordinary moment .
haydn remonstrated with the prince , but to no avail .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
the question you might ask though is : why do children learn so much ?
by far than any other animal .
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
but unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
ag : now this is his next idea .
so we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and then somebody , i think it was bmw , introduced a light that went out slowly .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; no , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
maybe there &apos;s an innocence to it .
poignancy is a word i love as a designer .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help meddling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
i can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
it &apos;s that easy to lose beauty , because beauty &apos;s incredibly difficult to do .
so we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
vannevar bush was the u.s. government &apos;s chief scientific adviser during the war . and in 1945 , he published an article in a magazine called atlantic monthly .

for example , if we &apos;d had tedxparis 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive vauban-style fortifications -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe. which was indeed the case in europe between 1650 and 1750 .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is preparing for defense or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking , then this environment is most likely to spark a conflict .

it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
and we &apos;ve had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were funded by the u.s. military , using these prototypes ,

so you can read &quot; architecture active &quot; or &quot; active architecture . &quot;
other ones are historical .
it &apos;s two panels 13 ft. high .
so artist books , you take them off the wall .
so the technique , it &apos;s cut , sandblasted , etched and printed glass into architectural glass .
i created &quot; all around town . &quot; it is a papercutting , and then after , i added color on the computer .
so let me show you a little of that .
and so we &apos;re sitting there , and eventually after about an hour , hour and a half of just going back and forth , he says , &quot; okay , i have enough information here .
i know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
basically , what i decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that &apos;s cool .
at coreana supermarket buying my kimchi because i like kimchi .
and then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all ,
so by me putting all this information out there , what i &apos;m basically telling you is i &apos;m telling you everything .
because it &apos;s about surveillance .
bg : on the day you are in a place where there is no coverage , the fbi gets crazy ?
i want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of morality .
so this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin , have to grab it fast and keep it cold .
the trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them .
so we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
it &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
&quot; well this is very valuable .
so who are these people who manipulate our oxytocin systems ?
we don &apos;t need god or government telling us what to do .
so even though i have a fear of heights , i recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft .
let me show it to you .
we looked at the historical attempts that had been out there and realized that , despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innovations to draw on today that weren &apos;t available previously -- we have modern composite materials , we have aircraft engines that get good fuel economy and have better power-to-rate ratios than have ever been available , we have glass cockpit avionics that bring the information you need to fly
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground , this may be counter-intuitive ,
radio : what did you think of that ?
and the unleaded automotive fuel that we use is both cheaper and better for the environment than traditional avgas .

it &apos;s a high school sport where you have 12 cups you have to stack and unstack against the clock in a prescribed order . and this is her getting the world record in real time .
now this noise is so great that society places a huge premium on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
and it has real beauty and real explanatory power .
and moreover , it profoundly changes your perceptions by what you do .
well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sensation generated by myself feels very different then if generated by another person .
which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other retaliating .
and if we look at what we start with , a quarter of a newton there , a number of turns , perfect would be that red line .

so let &apos;s take a deeper look .
this a place where the dead are brought in .
there &apos;s a blade here that &apos;s going to cut across a section of the tissue and transfer it to a microscope slide .
we take that tagged material and we put it on to something called a microarray .
and remember that we &apos;ve assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
and so it &apos;s very important for those researchers that we &apos;ve created this resource .
those kinds of studies require much larger populations .
and this is the first stop along the line .
a total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
there was also a 65 year-old man who participated .

so if , in fact , you want to live a life free of regret , there is an option open to you .
this session today is about behavioral economics .
and the thought was , &quot; make it go away ! &quot;
that night in my apartment , after i got done kicking myself and so forth , i lay in bed for a long time , and i thought about skin grafts .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; reply all &quot; regrets can leave us in a fit of excruciating agony for days .
it &apos;s just that i don &apos;t like how it looks .

it takes about an hour and a half to two hours , depending on where it &apos;s done , under general anesthesia .
i mentioned earlier the fact that music is a different capacity because it &apos;s abstract .
but it certainly wasn &apos;t the way the music was intended .
and yes , there is hope .
and here &apos;s a video of joseph .
but i tell you , if we lost our hearing , if anyone here suddenly lost your hearing , you would want perfect hearing back .
if this is true , we can help these movements .
now , at the end , nonviolent discipline . and this is probably the game-changer .

so i posed this question to him : how can we get 100 million people translating the web into every major language for free ? okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
then comes my favorite part of the question .
there &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
which is very surprising .
but the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .

so even if the tumor is not right on the surface , you &apos;ll still be able to see it .
who amongst us hasn &apos;t had swollen lymph nodes with a cold ?
we haven &apos;t had that many complications . &quot;
i think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .

a whole slew of reports , which were presented at the u.n. last year , which address the economic invisibility of nature and describe what can be done to solve it .
we did estimates in our study that for countries like brazil , india and indonesia ,
sorry , this is a global story .
and the chinese government responded sensibly and placed a ban on felling .
it &apos;s about energy emissions .
i don &apos;t think we can afford too much of such ethical choices .
so this is a plate of nachos .
so we don &apos;t always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
how can we take this idea of tricking your tastebuds and leapfrog it into something that we can do today that could be a disruptive food technology ?
i had no idea that at that moment my life was going to change forever .
and in fact , they started to call me a gomer .
i was wearing hospital scrubs .
but for me , i was an adult and it was embarrassing ,
and i was able to return to college because of the senior citizens who invested in me , and also the guide dog and skill set i had gained .
antonio damasio : the quest to understand consciousness
and which show you , in a living brain , the reconstruction of that brain .
and we are only fully conscious when self comes to mind .
so from the retina you go onto visual cortex .
if you deviate too much in the parameters that are close to the midline of that life-permitting survival range , you go into disease or death .
there was a very interesting film , one of the rare good films done about a situation like this , by julian schnabel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition .
and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
so that &apos;s a very good reason beyond curiosity to justify what we &apos;re doing , and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains .
all right , so tie me to the mast . &quot;
he just thinks about the here and now and the immediate gratification .
i was creating commitment devices of my own long before i knew what they were .
the more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
so my coauthors and i have used computers , the greatest tool of our time , to assist people &apos;s imagination and help them imagine what it might be like to go into the future .
as you move down the ladder of apartments , you see that they get worse and worse .
in which you not only get to see yourself in the future , but you get to see anticipated emotional reactions to different levels of retirement wealth .

so i stopped the car and i went to help .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
so we started .
everybody was grabbing something .
thank you very much .
and it &apos;s even cruel to think of anything like this .
and you know what ?
there are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan .

it turns out , most people over 50 feel better , are less stressed , are less hostile , less anxious .
as you may know , the entire world operates on a universal law : entropy , the second law of thermodynamics .
for me , it began as i was approaching my third act , my 60th birthday .
it turns out that cognitive research shows when we are able to do this , it manifests neurologically -- neural pathways are created in the brain .

what is the largest naval contingent tackling the issue of somali pirates ?
as we see from cyber warfare -- i have to speak to the minister of home affairs because who has entered my country , who lives in that terraced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country --
i started with a poem , i &apos;ll end with one .
the damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $ 15,000 .
or some even included references to the speakers , such as nathan myhrvold &apos;s speaking style , or the one of tim ferriss , which might be considered a bit strenuous at times .
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &apos;d been too much on google lately .
and unfortunately when i first received the answers -- and here you &apos;ll see six of the answers -- i was a bit disappointed .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
the second stage was completed at the penn state university main campus lab ,
and i want all of you to imagine a little girl holding a dead blue spinach plant .
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today .
thank you .
and this can be used by anyone .
can i have shree and lauren come up really quickly ?
so in a way , it is everybody &apos;s business .
now again , the military is necessary , but the military is no problem-solver .
it &apos;s hard , but it is necessary .

the real effects of sopa and pipa are going to be different than the proposed effects .
pipa and sopa are not oddities , they &apos;re not anomalies , they &apos;re not events .
well , i &apos;m not quite sure .
we have knowledge . we have sensations and experiences as well .
now this idea , that what we are , the way to understand ourselves , is as not of some permanent being , which has experiences , but is kind of a collection of experiences , might strike you as kind of weird .
so when you look at the brain , and you look at how the brain makes possible a sense of self , you find that there isn &apos;t a central control spot in the brain .

i want to introduce you to some of those entrepreneurs i &apos;ve met
she had started her business squatting in an abandoned garage , sewing sheets and pillow cases

ladies and gentlemen , i do not stand here today to tell you about the glory of weapons .
now nonviolence starts to work like a flywheel .
and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .
and once we get involved in the therapeutic decisions , again either personally or with our loved ones and family members , we also very quickly learn the benefits , the trade-offs and the limitations of these tools .

the surgeon was on call and scrubbed in .

which is good because , in these rural district hospitals , you &apos;re not going to get that level of training .
who gets surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike .
in that case , we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment .
and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car &apos;s actually there .
now there &apos;s a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs .
you &apos;ve got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones .
the police minister had a whole heap of public statements made about it .
it was routinely being used in this period , and , of course , still is routinely used -- because there were no complaints about it , not within the context of this study anyway -- it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent , who were potentially violent , and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant .
the final toll of hostages is a little unclear , but it &apos;s certainly a few more than that , because there were other people who died over the next few days .
and she says , &quot; oh , go ahead . tase me . &quot; and so he does .
the last thing that i would just like to say , when i &apos;m talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like , they almost inevitably say the same thing .
she could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care .
how does that impact our desert culture ?

it turns out , atrazine is the largest selling product for the largest chemical company in the world .
what &apos;s interesting is , in fact , the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the breast cancer promoter , now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company .
the evidence of that is that studies in rats , again with atrazine , show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion .
and so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta and go into your unborn child , it made me start to think , what would my fetus say to me ?
and the men who actually apply atrazine have even more atrazine in their urine , up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active are present in the urine of these men .

but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
and theoretically , i suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash , we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we &apos;ve got it pretty good .
and like i said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
and we &apos;re very lucky in ireland , we have plenty of basking sharks and plenty of opportunities to study them .
so i don &apos;t know what the balance is , but i think sharks have got more right to be fearful of us than we have of them .
there &apos;s now a ban on catching them and even landing them and even landing ones that are caught accidentally .
these are archival tags .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s great to have collaboration .

outside haiti also , things were looking different .
the tera system was developed from haiti with support of engineers in the region .
in mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , sms information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
it has always been the elusive ideal to ensure full participation of people affected by disasters in the humanitarian effort .
in manitoba , this is an image from the east side of lake winnipeg , and this is the home of the newly designated unesco cultural heritage site .

that &apos;s creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet .
the boreal forest sequesters more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem .
this would put a pipeline to take natural gas from the beaufort sea through the heart of the third largest watershed basin in the world , and the only one which is 95 percent intact .
it &apos;s going to color our possibility to survive , and for our children to survive and have a rich future .

in the world of the middle east at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shrill .
ever since i can remember thinking consciously about such things , communication has been my central passion .
now as to what i mean by the best comedy and satire , i mean work that comes first and foremost from a place of honesty and integrity .

people can &apos;t wait to pass along that new great joke .

geneticists have developed a similar tool called genetic barcoding .
and what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution .

durkheim believed that anything that unites us takes on an air of sacredness .
darwin noted that many of our virtues are of very little use to ourselves , but they &apos;re of great use to our groups .
but suppose then that one of them mutates .
darwin &apos;s laws don &apos;t change , but now there &apos;s a new kind of player on the field and things begin to look very different .
i can &apos;t be certain if the staircase is an adaptation rather than a bug , but if it is an adaptation , then the implications are profound .
they all want to find a cause or calling that they can throw themselves into .
this is the equivalent to the entire american corn crop failing along with all of our fruit crops , as well as wheat , tobacco , rice , sorghum -- whatever sorghum is -- losing sorghum .

to the point that i became obsessed with inventing a battery that could capture this gigantic economy of scale .
no , i hire a student and mentor him , teach him how to think about the problem , to see it from my perspective and then turn him loose .

now , as a world , there are lots of things we have to do in the global health community if we want to make the world better in the future -- things like fight diseases .
i studied really hard in college , and i was proud to be one of the very few female computer science graduates at my university .
and i thought -- that &apos;s it .
for instance , in the 1960s , india adopted very specific numeric targets and they paid women to accept having an iud placed in their bodies .
and she explained the income that she was getting out of her business afforded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children .
when they make that change and that decision , those become sweeping regional and national trends .
we looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time .
we &apos;re going to commit resources to it , and we &apos;re going to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educated -- so that if they want the tool , they have it , and that they have lots of options available either through their local healthcare worker or their local community rural clinic .

it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a lawyer .
and i see , even more importantly , the power of music to connect hearts .
his land was no longer registered in his name .
and this disorder is in direct contrast to the unalterable order of a bloodline .
three for evil spirits , one for an asthmatic condition and severe chest pain
so over a two-day period , six individuals from this bloodline were killed in the srebrenica massacre .
previously known as the department of foreign propaganda ,
tensions between these two families date back to 1913 when there was a dispute over local political power .
and it reads : &quot; those who do not know their past are not worthy of their future . &quot;
and i say most of us with forethought , as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born .
now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why .
which takes me to part two : string theory .
but over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
we &apos;re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
and this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the big bang theory .
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
we had to beat the european monarchy .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by june this year .
this is actually a station that we &apos;re doing in rio .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; vicious &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scenes .
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in rio .
and we cannot see that as a problem .
texting has a 100 percent open rate .
kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them
this is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
the key , two words :
js : now , there &apos;s now a real fancy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kicks it out .
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations .
and now i just got to talk about making as opposed to making them .
so she said , &quot; we talked about the middle passage . &quot;
&quot; but i &apos;d get to see them in america . &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
and the more i learned about the mexican culture -- my partner is mexican — the more i learned that , you know , for all of us , food is a basic need , but , and it is obviously with mexicans too , but it &apos;s much more than that .
and it &apos;s taught us really one thing , and that is to truly make good public space , you have to erase the distinctions between architecture , urbanism , landscape , media design and so on .
but beyond exhibiting contemporary art , the hirshhorn will become a public forum , a place of discourse for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
so this is the big idea .
and so we argued it on the merits of being a dome .
could be used for anything , for performances , films , for installations .
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , secure , healthy and durable .
moreover , this transition needs no new inventions and no acts of congress and no new federal taxes , mandate subsidies or laws and running washington gridlock .
the resulting shift to electric autos is going to be as game-changing as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers .
and combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes , now on the drawing board , can save close to a trillion dollars .
and they also converge the oil story with our second big story , saving electricity and then making it differently .
for example , pumps , the biggest use of motors , move liquid through pipes .
in contrast , the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fading because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk .
at about the same cost as business as usual , this would maximize national security , customer choice , entrepreneurial opportunity and innovation .
but as edgar woolard , who used to chair dupont , reminds us , &quot; companies hampered by old thinking won &apos;t be a problem because , &quot; he said , &quot; they simply won &apos;t be around long-term . &quot;
do you see how there &apos;s three peaks to the yellow sine wave ?
it &apos;s wavy .
it was like a really deep-down gut reaction , and i wanted to throw it out .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , i &apos;m not for one minute suggesting that sharing data is a bad thing .
i then go to a news site , look for some headlines .
this is me being a parent .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness .
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs .
i think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do .
red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
i propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn &apos;t even realize were problems at all .
it could really change things quite significantly .
and the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong .
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted .
the problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand ,
and , actually , reconciling all the contradictions i was feeling became easier once i understood that feminism was not a rulebook but a discussion , a conversation , a process ,

and he watched the ball fly for a second , and then he went , &quot; dah dadaratatatah .
and in the 17th century , it was more like this .
and by the 1400s , music was being written that tried to mirror god &apos;s mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the codebooks of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
at the same time technology , by taking over the role that notation had always played , shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .
there &apos;s just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , performers -- to be explorers together .
that was the family business .
and started finding out that actually human beings as primates have far smaller stomachs than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains .
because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consume this .

there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ideal for hibernation .
now , the series hasn &apos;t even aired yet , so you &apos;re the very first to see this .

it &apos;s inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
and we had eight startups sitting around there .
thank you .
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
it &apos;s to kill them when they &apos;re still in the water as larvae .
and the answer i have right here in my pocket , if i get it .

but only 30 percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago .
it &apos;s quite widespread .
so why is that ? well if you get the kiss now , it &apos;s over and done with .
and maybe the most surprising benefit of optimism is health .
what i wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that prevented us from taking these warning signs personally .
we were quite amazed by these results because we were able to eliminate a deep-rooted bias in humans .
but if you are an extreme optimistic penguin who just jumps down blindly hoping for the best , you might find yourself in a bit of a mess when you hit the ground .
&quot; today i walk . yesterday i walked . &quot;
companies like google have digitized many of them --
how a teacher shut them down or how a student was particularly cruel to them .
so he &apos;d take people to this two-way mirror
so i thought one of the things i &apos;d do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like .
so the quantitative results were great . but doug &apos;s results that he cared about were much more qualitative .
and they just make better decisions .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its overall shape .
but one of the most popular ones involves green fluorescent protein .

and he &apos;s here also today .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people participating , creating millions of views .
so obviously there &apos;s a massive housing gap ,
but i &apos;m obsessive , so i couldn &apos;t just stop there ,

the murmur of the city dissolves into a squall whose chilling power i no longer feel .
so you don &apos;t want me to street juggle here , right ?
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes flop , flop , flop and lands on my head .
and he tells me , he has on his desk a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a dove on my head .
but then something unexpected happened .
you know better than anyone that hiv brings out the best and the worst in humanity .
because stigma gives unofficial license to treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens .
but in order to do that we need to tackle an epidemic of really bad law .
where you criminalize people living with hiv or those at greatest risk , you fuel the epidemic .
thank you .
and the computer models , no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use , are never going to be able to arrive at the same conclusions .
here we go .
but my dad didn &apos;t get the kind of robot he wanted , either .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
and people are watching her on their screens ,
the idea is it allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in his own coordinate frame .
so we &apos;re able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like a surgical subtask , at 10 times the speed of a human .
also peaked , and they &apos;re now on the decline .
and maybe that makes you say , &quot; hmm . maybe this isn &apos;t going to be quite so easy . &quot;
bottom right , bangladesh has the same population density as bahrain but consumes 100 times less per person .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united kingdom with energy crops , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
they all have a small power per unit area ,
so let &apos;s talk about three more big levers that could really help on the consumption side .
you grasp it , you rotate it to the left , and your energy consumption in the home will decrease .
and if there is a lever you don &apos;t like the use of , well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other levers .
everything we know about archimedes as a mathematician we know about because of just three books ,
it got in worse condition in the 20th century after heiberg saw it .
and it &apos;s much tougher than the parchment that it was written on .
and it &apos;ll come out dark but red , and then you can start to read it rather clearly .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
hyperides found himself on trial for treason .

it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
eighty-eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help muslims progress -- the highest percentage of any country we surveyed .
what really changed after the ouster of mubarak wasn &apos;t that life got easier .
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
and i don &apos;t know what you expect , but when i was thinking about that issue , i early on realized what i &apos;m not able to give you are answers .
the effects that you &apos;re having with the device , like less fuel , as well as the effects of the actual tools you &apos;re using to get people to do things -- public recognition .
and that bias is that we &apos;re asking , is this or that &quot; still &quot; ethical ?
which is what peter-paul verbeek , the dutch philosopher of technology , says .

what we do know is , potentially , the brain is reacting in a hyperactive , hyper-plastic way , and creating individuals that are like this .
i think we &apos;re transitioning into homo evolutis that , for better or worse , is not just a hominid that &apos;s conscious of his or her environment , it &apos;s a hominid that &apos;s beginning to directly and deliberately control the evolution of its own species , of bacteria , of plants , of animals .
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my nine-year-old late last week -- penises are structures that transfer sperm from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like this earthworm , indeed most animals , don &apos;t support their tissues by draping them over bones .
it had the central fluid , it had the surrounding wall , and the reinforcing fibers in the wall were arranged in crossed helices around the long axis of the skeleton .
that &apos;s because we knew theoretically that there was another way of arranging fibers in a hydrostatic skeleton , and that was with fibers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long axis of the structure .

we could be intervening much more aggressively into dangerously dysfunctional homes , and getting kids out of them before their moms pick up butcher knives and threaten to kill them .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t remember anything from when i was five years old .
and what i want to talk to you about today , and share with you , is that our healthcare system , our medical system , is just as bad at predicting what happens to people in it -- patients , others -- as those scouts were at predicting what would happen to billy beane .
you have to have a high-tech experience of pregnancy , otherwise something might go wrong .
that &apos;s not very good for doctors &apos; business .
billy beane , by the way , learned the same thing . he learned , from watching this kid who he eventually hired , who was really successful for him , like the sluggers do , which is what all the expensive teams like the yankees like to -- they like to pick up those guys .

the last project i want to show you is this :
why is this happening ?

after this , we wanted to see if we could implement this and automate the system ,
so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pulling something long and heavy ,
they made it , but they eventually published a simplified design .

this idea is so pervasive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to regret -- that i hear it literally everywhere i go .
a recent study from the university of michigan showed that these games are incredibly powerful relationship-management tools .

and soon , i started hearing from people all over the world who were adopting their own secret identity , recruiting their own allies , and they were getting &quot; super better , &quot; facing challenges like cancer and chronic pain , depression and crohn &apos;s disease .
i wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so i devoured the scientific literature , and here &apos;s what i learned .
so tackling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as absurd as snapping your fingers exactly 50 times or counting backwards from 100 by seven is actually a scientifically validated way to boost your willpower .
it turns out that people who regularly boost these four types of resilience -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else .

every time her ex-boyfriend would show up , at the most improbable times and the most improbable locations , he was carrying an open laptop ,
chinese manufacturers now sell thousands of nearly identical devices on the internet .
but if you send in a fake gps signal , another peak pops up , and if you can get these two peaks perfectly aligned , the tracking points can &apos;t tell the difference ,
so something felt very wrong about the world .
&lt; / doc &gt;
you , like the people that are trapped in my work
so , the guy is telling the cat , don &apos;t you dare think outside the box .
so for various reasons , we took this oncogene , attached it to a blue marker , and we injected it into the embryos .
we found some gooey material that had the right extracellular matrix in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they got reorganized
we inject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tumors .
you put the cancer cells there , and they do go all over ,
but we know nothing , but nothing , about the language and alphabet of form .
and combined , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
and , i &apos;d argue , the security and future of you and your family is also at stake .
with population increases , consumption patterns increasing , and conflict over scarce natural resources .
jd : it does , and we &apos;re having a huge debate in this country about aid levels , for example , and aid alone is not the whole solution . nobody thinks it is .
so i &apos;ve never seen color ,
because color is almost everywhere ,

i would close by saying that we heard earlier today about wikipedia . i use wikipedia all the time to look up facts , and as all of you appreciate , wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people locked in a room writing articles .
a simplistic answer would be , the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves legally .

it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint ,
and it &apos;s pretty incredible because i took my iphone there , and he was like , &quot; yeah , do you want an upgrade ? &quot;
so , we kind of toyed around with this idea , and we said , &quot; what can we do with this ?
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
in the sense that it really dissuades people from getting access to health care .
&lt; speaker &gt; john graham-cumming &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i &apos;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that &apos;s why it &apos;s computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
which was weaving these incredible patterns controlled by punch cards ,
because of course , there &apos;s never been a mathematician that &apos;s gone crazy ,
it doesn &apos;t matter if your computer &apos;s mechanical , like babbage &apos;s was , or electronic , like computers are today ,
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you &apos;ve got to look at this humongous thing and say , &quot; ah , i see the memory operating , i see the cpu operating ,
i propose we look to nature .
we can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape , or this shape .
and that we can use to control the folding .
in this case , the process is deterministic .
and this is a photo now , it &apos;s not a rendering ,

george drained another glass of claret and turned to me .
we don &apos;t even find dead bodies .
looking at this picture on the left of new york city today ,
so the problems of bees today isn &apos;t necessarily
so we need bees and they &apos;re disappearing and it &apos;s a big problem .
we also have a classroom hives project ,
the bee dies . honeybees die when they sting , so they don &apos;t want to do it either . it &apos;s nothing to panic about . they &apos;re all over the city .
the four countries have no access to facebook .
you have twitter , we have weibo .
so when these 300 million people , microbloggers , even they block the tweet in our censored platform . but itself -- the chinanet -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the chinese history .
so because of this , the chinese really regard this microblogging as a media , not only a headline to media .
so this weibo social media , even in the censorship , still gave the chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together , talking together .
you know , the server is in the &#91; central &#93; cats &apos; hands ,
it &apos;s very simple , because chinese central government doesn &apos;t need to even lead the public opinion .

so now i &apos;m in a parking lot . basically it &apos;s a tin can , and i &apos;m basically recreating the launch with fire extinguishers , fire , i have wax that i threw in front of the lens to look like ice , and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you , what you were reacting to , what you &apos;re emoting to , is something that &apos;s a total falsehood , and i found that
so he twisted his memory around .
and i found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use , and it caused me to create the next effect that i &apos;ll show you , which is
so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .

and this is what it looks like in my classroom .
and we actually moved into the hamptons , payed 3,500 dollars a week for a house , and we learned how to surf .
and when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the south bronx , so did the international community .
and that to me , people , is another true &quot; sí se puede &quot; moment .

i grow seven kinds of mint in my class .
so , my good friend kermit said it &apos;s not easy being green .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not readily accessible .
so to put that number in perspective , for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford class , he would have to do that for 250 years .
or ryan , who can &apos;t go to school , because his immune deficient daughter can &apos;t be risked to have germs come into the house , so he couldn &apos;t leave the house .
this one that appeared in science last year , for example , demonstrates that even simple retrieval practice , where students are just supposed to repeat what they already learned gives considerably improved results on various achievement tests down the line than many other educational interventions .
now , of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all courses .
the first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely unprecedented look into understanding human learning .
imagine if we could teach so that 98 percent of our students would be above average .
and if we could offer that person an education , they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us .

jeff han : multi-touch sensing isn &apos;t anything --
and the sum looks like this .
so i decided to look for a thousand different noes. on everything ever produced under islamic or arab patronage in the past 1,400 years , from spain to the borders of china .
after acts of violence , another artist came , painted blood , protesters being run over by the tank , demonstrators , and a message that read , &quot; starting tomorrow , i wear the new face , the face of every martyr . i exist . &quot;
and the answer would appear to be yes , and the language would appear to be food .
so we invented , without asking , of course , the incredible edible green route .
and we now have farmers doing cheese

although that figure rises to four percent of ceos and business leaders ,
he &apos;d close down 30 percent of the workforce .
admittedly , his first wife cited in her divorce papers that he once threatened her with a knife and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like ,

they took to it immediately , and now they are forces of nature .
a couple months ago , payne started a food blog called neverseconds , and she would take her camera with her every day to school to document her school lunches .
we are a pro-printing press society .
to a first approximation , the problem of managing a large software project is the problem of keeping this social chaos at bay .
people would literally mail him changes that they &apos;d agreed on , and he would merge them by hand .
out of this community , but using these tools , they can now create something together .
now , i would love to tell you that the fact that the open-source programmers have worked out a collaborative method that is large scale , distributed , cheap , and in sync with the ideals of democracy , i would love to tell you that because those tools are in place , the innovation is inevitable . but it &apos;s not .

because you know what to do about the protests .
it was the human rights moment .
now we have the reverse tendency .
this is probably true .
so when we talk about transparency , when we talk about openness , i really do believe that what we should keep in mind is that what went right is what went wrong .
it turns out half of those kids , or about 1.8 million newborns around the world , would make it if you could just keep them warm for the first three days , maybe the first week .

chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for ipods .
just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
she paused and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6,000 yuan or 6,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6,000 . &quot; min &apos;s sister &apos;s boyfriend , who had traveled home with her for the new year , said , &quot; it doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s worth that much . &quot;
and it is globalization , this chain that begins in a chinese farming village and ends with iphones in our pockets and nikes on our feet and coach handbags on our arms
i mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that &apos;s not why they &apos;re in the city , and that &apos;s not what they care about .
ogandiro smokes fish in makoko in lagos ,

well today , i &apos;m very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you
indeed , to implement the slogan of health for all , we will need to involve all in that particular journey ,
now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products , like cars and computers ,
sure , we invest plenty in innovation . we invest in broadband and science education and science grants , but we invest far too little in reinventing and redesigning the institutions that we have .
it &apos;s also about creating government .
and we see lots of examples of these innovators using open government data , not simply to make apps , but then to make companies and to hire people to build them working with the government .
obviously opening up the data is one , but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and curate -- lots more participatory opportunities .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
and particularly in the developing world , it &apos;s where women find opportunities .
and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood .
you just spin and go directly in . so we &apos;ve been working with a company to commercialize this .

first of all , we have all the statistical analyses from the innocence project work ,
take all the measurements and record them , right ?
so in fact , we found the same identical conditions , we reconstructed the entire thing again ,
why did i take the risk ?
we all have to be very careful .
that is to say , microalgae contributes between 2,000 and 5,000 gallons per acre per year , compared to the 50 gallons per acre per year from soy .
so you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; gee , this sounds like a good idea . what can we do to try to see if it &apos;s real ? &quot;
harvest that by a procedure where you float the algae
we &apos;d be growing oysters and things that would be producing high value products and food ,
sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many .
because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
this was really an extraordinary advance , because although these cells are not human embryonic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terrific to use for modeling disease and potentially for drug discovery .
and you &apos;re going to know at the beginning , the very early stages of doing your assay development
so that is terrific ,

this was great . my pigs turned that food waste into delicious pork . i sold that pork to my school friends &apos; parents , and i made a good pocket money addition to my teenage allowance .
so i decided to unpack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or false .
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste , what ends up in the garbage , what ends up in supermarket bins , what ends up in restaurant bins . we &apos;ve lost another two ,
liver , lungs , heads , tails , kidneys , testicles , all of these things which are traditional , delicious and nutritious parts of our gastronomy go to waste . offal consumption has halved in britain and america in the last 30 years .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : shimon schocken and noam nisan developed a curriculum for their students to build a computer , piece by piece . when they put the course online -- giving away the tools , simulators , chip specifications and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jumped at the opportunity to learn , working independently as well as organizing their own classes in the first massive open online course . a call to forget about grades and tap into the self-motivation to learn .
so i &apos;d like to share with you a story about a self-study , self-empowering computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant colleague noam nisan .
and parag shah , another engineer , from mumbai , has unbundled our projects into smaller , more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do-it-yourself computer science program .
and share with you a glimpse from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-learning , learning by doing , self-exploration and community-building ,
and because we cannot do it on our own , we &apos;ve developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author , any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education , can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming .

let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people &apos;s guesses along these dimensions actually were .
and then the final reason , which i mention , especially to a ted audience , with some trepidation , has to do with what i call &quot; techno-trances . &quot;
or to take an even more striking example , when the chicago council on foreign relations did a survey of americans , asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid , the guess was 30 percent , which is slightly in excess of the actual level — — of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid .
the children looked and were amazed .
and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
all of them except one . can you guess which one ?
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth ,
sharing accountability . also , the fact that he threatened to sue me because i got a leak of his leaks , i thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology , to be honest , as well . the other thing is that power is incredibly seductive , and you must have two real qualities , i think , when you come to the table , when you &apos;re dealing with power , talking about power , because of its seductive capacity .
well , to go back to our original story , the parents have panicked . they &apos;ve locked all the doors .
but how can i tell an eight-year-old boy that his father is a politician ? &quot; now , as a politician myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stranger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reveal the nature of my profession , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a snake , a monkey and an iguana ,
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy .
it &apos;s not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors .
if local democracy is to flourish , it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen .
i know famous musicians , i know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers , all who were looked after children , fostered , adopted or orphaned , and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background , as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground , as if it were somehow kryptonite , as if it were a time bomb
she lands months before the beatles release &quot; the white album , &quot; months before martin luther king was killed .
the theology was perfect , the timing unquestionable , and the answer as honest as a sinner could get .
i &apos;m not defining a good family from a bad family .
if you are willing to do this , you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance , and you &apos;ll see that face , the tongue stick out , the wrinkled nose ,
david pizarro : so my favorite part of this clip is that professor dawkins actually gagged .
when you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they &apos;re willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that &apos;s been baked to look like dog poop , or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross , your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you &apos;ll be willing to engage in those behaviors .
these all have similar effects on judgment .
thank you .
they give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere ,
and in other areas , it &apos;s a ventilating system , so that hot , trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary .
when you &apos;re tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day , when you &apos;re on vacation and there &apos;s no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls , or when there &apos;s a power outage , and you have no electricity to rely on , these thermo-bimetals will still be working tirelessly , efficiently and endlessly . thank you .
only i later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days .
recently , the world bank opened its vault of data for public use , releasing 8,000 economic and social indicators for 200 countries over 50 years , and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data .
in august , 2011 . but within a few weeks ,
thank you .
those of us who remember the newspaper reports that came out of romania after the 1989 revolution will recall the horrors of the conditions in some of those institutions .
most of these children will never leave the institution again .
one study suggests that a family support service costs 10 percent of an institutional placement , whilst good quality foster care costs usually about 30 percent .

which is a conversation starter , let me tell you . if you ever need one , just carry one of these . and a man just stared at me , and he was like , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you use the internet ? &quot;
and that can be seen directly through a microscope , and i &apos;m going to show you some of this today .
what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen , when you look in a microscope , it &apos;s actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen .
every single grain is different . there are no two grains
and these are actually microscopic ; you need a microscope to see these .
one of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly .
now , this is western society , and what i hope to do tonight is to convince you of the chinese traditional culture , that they perceive bats as
your genome is made up of your dna ,
so bats are also important for our health , to enable us to better understand how our genome functions .
there are 19 species of mammal that live longer than expected , given their body size , than man ,
well , normally , a charity starts with the cause , and someone that is directly affected by a cause .
we can &apos;t have anything to do with you . &quot; so i paid for coffee that day — — and his parting comment as we shook hands was , &quot; listen , if you happen to raise any money out of this , we &apos;ll gladly take it . &quot; so my lesson that year was persistence .
we were sort of very gung ho with our success in australia and new zealand at that stage .
and i said , &quot; okay , that &apos;s interesting . &quot;
and so we said , right , we &apos;d redefined charity . we need
it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us
what i &apos;d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we &apos;ve been investigating , and that &apos;s mind-wandering .
nope . as it turns out , people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example ,
in my talk today , i &apos;ve told you a little bit about mind-wandering , a variable that i think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness .
he lost purpose . he lost his community .
again , you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in kansas city .
wouldn &apos;t that be so cool , and that wouldn &apos;t that open up all sorts of new possibilities ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : if you had to walk a mile for a jug of water every day , as millions of people do , it &apos;s unlikely you &apos;d use that precious water to bathe . young entrepreneur ludwick marishane tells the amazing , funny story of how he invented a cheap , clean and convenient solution : drybath , the world &apos;s first bath-substituting lotion .

and they &apos;re aimed at protecting the relationships .
i can assure you there &apos;s deception there .
along the bottom is how tall they said they were in their profile .
but i think there &apos;s actually something much more
you remember those astroturfing reviews that we were
this isn &apos;t a deception-detection machine to tell if your girlfriend &apos;s lying to you on text messaging .
on my desk in my office , i keep a small clay pot
when i sat down to write a book about creativity , i realized that the steps were reversed .
richard ford : i was slow to learn to read , went all the way
jb : richard serra says that so nonchalantly , you might have missed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who &apos;d been dead for 300 years , and realized , &quot; i can &apos;t do that , &quot; and so richard serra went back to his studio in florence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and threw it in a river .
probably from the blow , because it was an insult in a way .
you have to take a picture .
then , being her husband , i ran behind her

in this machine , any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant , anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall .
like that , i never chased mahalakshmi .
and the majority of these people live in rural areas , where the only connections to community , to employment , to education , are by traveling long distances on rough terrain often under their own power .
and you could make it using technology that &apos;s been around for hundreds of years .
so as a wet-behind-the-ears student , excited , our team made a prototype , brought that prototype to tanzania , kenya and vietnam in 2008 , and found it was terrible
these are the people that define the requirements of the technology , and these are the people that have to give the thumbs-up at the end , and say , &quot; yeah , it actually works . it meets our needs . &quot;

&#91; &quot; horse &quot; &#93; db : yellow . audience : yellow .
the other one is the frontal lobe , which controls how we sustain attention , and another one is the anterior cingulate , which controls how we allocate and regulate attention and resolve conflict .
now because we are interested in having an impact for education or rehabilitation of patients , we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform .
there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely deft at coming up with appealing products that you can &apos;t resist .
we call ourselves the sleepy man banjo boys .
&quot; oh , but surely someone must be in charge .
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to charges .
and the other question , who changed their mind ? who changed their opinion , and why ?
life was good .
&quot; come on . this is our opportunity . &quot;
and if you walk again , it will be with calipers and a walking frame . &quot;
and even lying paralyzed in the spinal ward , there were moments of incredible depth and richness , of authenticity and connection that i had never experienced before .

and it was this particular little behavior , the dance , that we thought was important , because look , it takes a pause every now and then , and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in .
it isn &apos;t climbing . it isn &apos;t dancing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .

the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of siberia up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the arctic ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fearless felix baumgartner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreciate the sense of apprehension , as i sat in a helicopter thundering north , and the sense , i think if anything , of impending doom .
i can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship i &apos;ve ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
i &apos;m well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . you &apos;ll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community .

a driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go up the coast of france and the owner gave it to them , and said , &quot; you know what , here &apos;s where the cliffs are , and here &apos;s all the beaches , and this is my best beach , and this is where the best fish restaurant is . &quot;

ted talk subtitles and transcript : when war between israel and iran seemed imminent , israeli graphic designer ronny edry shared a poster on facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message : &quot; iranians ... we &#91; heart &#93; you . &quot; other israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and iranians responded in kind . the simple act of communication inspired surprising facebook communities like &quot; israel loves iran , &quot; &quot; iran loves israel &quot; and even &quot; palestine loves israel . &quot;
so i start answering this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come ,
they have graphic designers . what ? crazy , crazy .
today the israel-loves-iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i don &apos;t know , commented on one of the photos .
at some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
just raise that . exactly .
they just fought off a king . they &apos;re not going to accept some central authority . &quot;
especially if we raise taxes on the rich .
but here &apos;s what i learned .
that is democratic and republican issues ,
you were a free market capitalist economist or you were a keynesian liberal economist ,
then you can see radical partisan change .
the fear is that the world is watching .
giambattista della porta , a neapolitan scholar in the 16th century , examined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipulated .
now , when you talk about dangerous animals , most people might think of lions or tigers or sharks .
and that &apos;s the nickname given to this disease . it &apos;s called breakbone fever , because that &apos;s how you can feel .
interestingly , madeira first got the insect in 2005 , and here we are , a few years later , first cases of dengue .
we want something that &apos;s relatively cheap , or cost-effective , because there &apos;s an awful lot of countries involved ,
if they don &apos;t find a female , then they &apos;ll die anyway .
and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enzymes for industrial processing , enzymes , genetically engineered enzymes in food .
hansen says we can expect about a five-meter rise in sea levels .
let me translate for you .
we love to circle around things .
it &apos;s so that the bloods and the crips will know which side to vote for . the polarization is strongest among our political elites .
these changes are detailed in many books .
should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up and descends into paralysis and polarization ?
but it &apos;s not just money . it &apos;s also stability versus chaos .
so to conclude , there are at least four asteroids headed our way .
let us therefore go to battle stations ,
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
now you have this concept in your mind . you &apos;re all part of the artwork too .

my favorite page is the &quot; about the author &quot; page .
i was really into bell biv devoe and mc hammer and vanilla ice at the time . and to this day , i still can do karaoke to &quot; ice , ice baby &quot; without looking at the screen . don &apos;t tempt me , because i will do it .
and i loved that thought , of being able to share my ideas through the printed page .
now when i was a teenager , i was angsty as any teenager was , but after 17 years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a yo-yo and a father who was faceless , i was angry .
now , i used to work the weekends at the hole in the wall off-season programming to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground ,

on the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools ,
for example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like celine , let alone understand .
why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place . now , fortunately for celine ,
and they are not magnanimous in victory .
and that really prevented the rickets that used to be common in this city .
it &apos;s not the heart . what do you do ?
not by much , as an individual level , but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population .
so here , further data that ultraviolet -- that &apos;s sunlight -- has benefits on the blood flow and the cardiovascular system .
my day job is saying to people , &quot; you &apos;ve got skin cancer , it &apos;s caused by sunlight , don &apos;t go in the sun . &quot;
nobody wants an operation . in particular , nobody wants an operation with tools like these through large incisions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big scar .
and eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve mastery .
it &apos;s the primary harvard medical school teaching facility .

kids will sometimes perform monodramas -- playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play .
take a look at this sentence : &quot; one morning , as gregor samsa was waking up from anxious dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug . &quot;
they talk about these kinds of experiences .
i was trying my best , and my teacher came around and asked me , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
that was duchamp .
so we start to envy them .
they only get to think for the first five minutes .
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs .
so what should we do now ?
i &apos;m totally clueless .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instructions .
there is this obsession with seriousness .
we have to convince our audience that what we &apos;re talking about matters .
thank you .
at this level of the labor market , what you need is a marketplace for spare hours .
imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic pyramid , very little prospect of getting a job -- what economic activity could she theoretically engage in ?
and those facilities -- i &apos;m talking about things like the mechanisms that prove our identity , the licensing authorities that know what each of us is allowed to do legally at any given time , the processes by which we resolve disputes through official channels .
think of it as a regulated public utility .
and they might be aware that they would have to fund vetting and training if they wanted to go into that market .
so i started thinking about what should i get my mom for mother &apos;s day ?
now maybe you won &apos;t be so surprised by this , because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology .
after you &apos;ve created your program , you can click on &quot; share , &quot; and then share your project with other people , so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well .
when you learn to read and write , it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things .
and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better .
it &apos;s scratch.mit.edu ,
most people died around the age of 50 .
water consumption has increased to 430 liters .
do you worry much ?
or should we use something else ?
well to start to do this , we took a 3d printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

the rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost .

reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer , and not reinventing people based on a ready-made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us .

and was one of the lowest education performers .
opportunities are unequally distributed .
and you can see korea investing a lot in attracting the best people into the teaching profession .
but there are some countries which have seen impressive improvements .
and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an impressive improvement .
but usually that is linked to very strong social disparities .
they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pedagogical practices .
if we can help every child , every teacher , every school , every principal , every parent see what improvement is possible , that only the sky is the limit to education improvement , we have laid the foundations for better policies and better lives .
i ended up in physics by accident .
this is a surprising and prominent gap in the literature .
because a foundational guideline in science is : let the data speak . okay . let &apos;s do that .
this ended up giving him control in telecom italia with a leverage of 26 .
yet it &quot; gave us a tantalizing glimpse of a brave new world of finance . &quot;
and why is the forbidden so erotic ?
so now we get to the existential reality of the story , right ?
but then the second group is even more interesting . i am most drawn to my partner when i see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she &apos;s doing something she &apos;s passionate about , when i see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when i see her hold court .
what do you seek to express there ?
and when i began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that i work with , i sometimes would hear people say , &quot; i want more sex , &quot;
but if on this side there is somebody who says , &quot; i &apos;m worried . i &apos;m anxious . i &apos;m depressed .
they also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
what i &apos;m here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis and some surprisingly powerful new findings that i &apos;ve been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak
now , that fascinated me endlessly as a child , but what fascinates me even more today as an economist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time . so for example , if i &apos;m speaking in english , i have to speak grammatically differently if i &apos;m talking about past rain , &quot; it rained yesterday , &quot; current rain , &quot; it is raining now , &quot; or future rain , &quot; it will rain tomorrow . &quot;
interestingly enough , when you start to crank the data , these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world &apos;s best savers .
and what i &apos;m going to do is form statistical matched pairs between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that i can measure , and then i &apos;m going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds even after controlling for all of these levels .
it &apos;s almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn &apos;t present .
and the sound of a brainstorm , if you &apos;ve never heard one , is somewhat like this .
and could act outside , in that outside world , just by controlling an artificial device .
the legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
so where are we taking all this ?
these people are tall .
and if my mother ever questioned him , he beat her , abused her , and really it was difficult .
there was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us .
don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot;
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning
because there had not been any school for girls .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
those alien creatures right on earth .
and it turns out that the insects flap their wings in a very clever way , at a very high angle of attack
the halteres are actually gyroscopes .
and then something happened when i started to work on flies .
i would posit that one frontier in neuroscience is to figure out how the brain of that thing works .
you can let the fly play a little video game by letting it fly around in a visual display .
so here &apos;s two sort of canonical neurons from a vertebrate and an invertebrate ,
eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in .
they turned to a cutting-edge program called agile development
they do things in small chunks .
he said , &quot; in the workplace , adults love it .
so what did we learn ?
an environmental psychologist told me , &quot; if you &apos;re sitting in a hard chair on a rigid surface , you &apos;ll be more rigid .
but we &apos;re giving them practice becoming independent , which of course is our ultimate goal .
and we ended up with 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna karenina &quot; and its famous opening sentence , &quot; all happy families are alike .
&lt; / doc &gt;
they made another machine to produce those people : the school .
how is present-day schooling going to prepare them
so i said , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pronunciation is really bad ,
&quot; and anyway , i am going away . &quot;
so she did that for two more months .
what an achievement that is .
she goes on over skype and she sorts things out .
here &apos;s a sole in action .
so we need to design a future for learning .
she suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; get on with it . &quot;
we can fix this . we &apos;re going to go to greenville with my whole cabinet and we will just make electrolux an offer they can &apos;t refuse . &quot;
who is ever going to hire me ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh my god -- congress , gridlock , who knows ? &quot;
it &apos;s opt-in . you might even get texas and south carolina , who didn &apos;t opt into the education race to the top , you might even get them to opt in . why ?
&lt; speaker &gt; amanda palmer &lt; / speaker &gt;
so after all of our shows , we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people ,
and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken english , &quot; your music has helped my daughter so much .
and the label considers this a failure .
they don &apos;t want to ask for things .
so a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price .
but fossil fuels , carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is causing climate change .
now we know that desertification is caused by livestock , mostly cattle , sheep and goats , overgrazing the plants ,
and the authors of the position paper on climate change from which i obtained these pictures attribute this change to &quot; unknown processes . &quot;
and we are burning in africa , every single year , more than one billion hectares of grasslands , and almost nobody is talking about it .
but we biologists and ecologists had never tackled anything as complex as this . so rather than reinvent the wheel , i began studying other professions to see if anybody had .
and i &apos;ve had to mark the hill because the change is so profound .
i &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the discovery channel documentary are no doubt aware .
whereas all previous expeditions had failed to garner a single video glimpse of the giant , we managed six , and the first triggered wild excitement .
there are great discoveries yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures representing millions of years of evolution and possibly bioactive compounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
when i was a kid , i traded in homework assignments for friendship , then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time , and in most cases , not at all .
to this day , i hate pork chops .
and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration , he remains a conversation piece between people who can &apos;t understand sometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity .
but our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty .
i sit on the board of a center for the developmentally disabled ,
businessweek did a survey , looked at the compensation packages for mbas 10 years out of business school . and the median compensation for a stanford mba ,
that &apos;s an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the nonprofit sector has not been able to wrestle any market share
well , like most fanatical dogma in america , these ideas come from old puritan beliefs .
within nine years , we had multiplied that 1,982 times , into 108 million dollars after all expenses , for aids services .
that &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
but we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatric disorders because of the overwhelming dominance of this chemical imbalance hypothesis .
well , one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general characteristics or properties of emotion-like states
there are repositories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vials of flies of different mutants
now what &apos;s the causal relationship , if anything , between these phenotypes ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
a local newspaper spelled out , &quot; there is no survivor , there is no future , there is no life to be recreated in this form ever again . &quot;
it &apos;s dna which is pretty badly fragmented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reassemble the whole genome .
so this meeting in boston led to three things . first off , ryan and i decided to create a nonprofit called revive and restore that would push de-extinction generally
alberto worked with the bucardo in spain .
real falcons out of slightly doctored chickens .
that technology will be used on de-extincted animals .
so ben novak , even as we speak , is joining the group
i think that &apos;s , you know , part of how it &apos;ll work .
you , your miserableness , have got to be kidding . &quot;
have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remotely as important as that number ? wow .
model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazilian model ? -- but look at sub-saharan africa .
you can tell politicians that these cuts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
might we answer that clarion call with science , with reason , with facts , and , dare i say it , emotions ?
or at the very least make informed decisions about what to buy .
and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of .
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work ,

it was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defense department ,
that will not succeed .
when you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
there &apos;s no clear backup system that we &apos;ve very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
i think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
and then you have to have a low drag coefficient so that you have good highway range .
em : there actually are far more charging stations than people realize ,
em : well actually , i &apos;m confident that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
so it &apos;s possible to achieve , let &apos;s say , roughly 100-fold improvement in the cost of spaceflight if you can effectively reuse the rocket .
i don &apos;t have a good answer for you .

well , wouldn &apos;t it be nice if it was that easy ?
but it &apos;s taken a long time to get there .
in an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon ,
please join me in thanking and welcoming sam .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
i think it &apos;ll be the goal of the poets and the muppets and the surfers and the bankers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we &apos;re trying to do here and why it matters .
now fast forward to just three years ago .

this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project .
another facet of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often cluster rooms together to facilitate interactions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in labs and in offices .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
so what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1701 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
other people who are a little more sophisticated , using more working memory , say , &quot; i think people will pick 33 because they &apos;re going to pick a response to 50 , and so i &apos;ll pick 22 , which is two-thirds of 33 . &quot;
your behavior at the end and pay you if you win .
if 10 seconds goes by and they haven &apos;t made a deal , they get nothing .
your intuition might tell you that too .
we share more genes with them than zebras do with horses .
one chimp is called a matcher .
so here are some things we learned today .
in order to run in the general election , you must do extremely well
now , what can we say about this democracy in usa-land ?
i don &apos;t mean rod blagojevich sense of corruption .
block reform .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans , to spread it out , to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone .
when connecticut adopted this system , in the very first year , 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only .
so here &apos;s my question : do you have that love ?
the only thing i had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stuffed for the collection .
so after six years , my friends and colleagues urged me to publish ,
yeah ?
i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ?
oh , sorry .
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the portability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
if you read books of people who climb mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people legos , and we asked them to build with legos .
and if they said yes , they built it . then we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
there was a very nice correlation between the love of legos and the amount of legos people built .
if the ceo , just like our participants , thought the essence of meaning is unimportant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes .
they took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
because in reality , it was even uglier than the first version .
is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
but if we look at the human scale , there &apos;s massive problems that aren &apos;t being addressed by those nanoscale technologies .
in three dimensions , we did a project last year at tedglobal with autodesk and arthur olson where we looked at autonomous parts -- so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own .

and later , in the mid- &apos; 80s , when &quot; jeopardy &quot; came back on the air ,
and i would do it for nothing .
and i realized , this is it .
and you could hear that little tick , tick , tick , tick .
and as a result , a part of our brain that &apos;s supposed to do that kind of stuff
if you can &apos;t do that first step , are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you &apos;re going to need to know to master your knowledge of u.s. foreign policy ?
or your alma mater or your job , and i know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rolling .
those are the two choices we have . i know which future i would rather be living in .
okay . and actually of those hands , if you don &apos;t include roomba how many of you have a robot at home ?
now this is a free app on the app store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together .
thanks , scott .

and they came into my room the next morning .
and we produced a number of people in law , all the way to the humanities .
we need to find ways of making it happen .
but she had a factor that was very important .
and what was interesting was each one of them focused on that work .
and most important , giving them a chance to build that community with faculty pulling them into the work and our assessing what works and what does not work .
with six doctors across two hospitals in this clash of medical titans to figure out which one of them was right about what was wrong with me .
this is libby , or actually , this is an ultrasound image of libby .
tb : yeah , let &apos;s do that .
this was me in third grade .
eighty percent of medical errors are actually caused by communication and coordination problems amongst medical team members .
we &apos;re trying to help build a social network that can help track and train the care of seniors
i happened to be an early guinea pig ,
and i &apos;ve done that here today ,
a young cambridge scholar named william whewell stood up and quieted the audience .
it was time for a new revolution , which they pledged to bring about ,
these tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers ,
but prizes were only given after the fact , when they were given at all .
rose george : let &apos;s talk crap . seriously .
but if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
but then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply ,
it &apos;s not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law &apos;s house .
it &apos;s the most off-track millennium development goal .
thomas insel : toward a new understanding of mental illness
what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is .
actually , i work for you . you pay my salary .
it &apos;s a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like huntington &apos;s or parkinson &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease where you have a bombed-out part of your cortex .
now to be clear , we &apos;re not quite ready to do this .
i palmed the ball in my large right hand , and when that hand reached the rim , i felt invincible .
i didn &apos;t mention to abed his prior driving record -- 27 violations by the age of 25 , the last , his not shifting his truck into a low gear on that may day —
i pulled into the town of abu ghosh , and bought a brick of turkish delight : pistachios glued in rosewater . better .
and was soon in kfar kara .
he wore black and white : slippers over socks , pilling sweatpants , a piebald sweater , a striped ski cap pulled down to his forehead .
i &apos;d hoped for something simpler : to exchange a turkish dessert for two words and be on my way .
was it evidence of guilt , an assertion that he should have been put away longer ?
i wished to tell him that not only paralyzers and paralyzees must evolve , reconcile to reality , but we all must -- the aging and the anxious and the divorced and the balding and the bankrupt and everyone .
&lt; speaker &gt; black &lt; / speaker &gt;
so i quit my company and started a career as a professional performer .
not much has changed , by the way . but they thought that , if you had a neurologic or psychiatric disease , it must be because you are possessed by an evil spirit .
again , we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime , putting an electrode in , and then this electrode
so we use electricity to dictate how they fire , and we try to block their misbehavior using electricity .
this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life .
and then , after three months of continuous stimulation , 24 hours a day , or six months of continuous stimulation , we have a complete reversal of this .
and as you go from being normal to having mild cognitive impairment , which is a precursor for alzheimer &apos;s , all the way to alzheimer &apos;s disease , then there are areas of the brain that stop using glucose .
we can turn them down if they are overactive , if they &apos;re causing trouble , trouble that is felt throughout the brain ,
but according to traditional estimates , if humanity had existed for 24 hours , then writing only came along at about 11 : 07 p.m .
the gettysburg address was not the main meal of that event .
and so , for example , there is in texting a convention , which is lol .
another example is &quot; slash . &quot;
so , &quot; from every college in the country goes up the cry , &apos; our freshmen can &apos;t spell , can &apos;t punctuate . &apos; &quot; and so on . you can go even further back than this .
that &apos;d be the second thing .
and here &apos;s my theme : because of the headwinds , if innovation continues to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years , growth is cut in half .
that means we &apos;d go from 44,000 to 180,000 .
are we going to grow at 0.8 ?
that &apos;s the percentage of american agricultural land
fast forward through the &apos; 90s ,
the amazing thing is that productivity did not increase in those factories for 30 years . thirty years .
it &apos;s growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution .
i used to teach my students that there are some things , you know , computers just aren &apos;t good at , like driving a car through traffic .
this is the great decoupling of productivity from employment , of wealth from work .
technology is not destiny .
on the wall behind them is the slogan of the cultural revolution : &quot; the core force leading our cause forward is the chinese communist party . &quot;
when i work on a new piece , i pay more attention to the expression of ideas .
two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria
so we thought , you know what ? instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up , let &apos;s find a way to break them down with bacteria .
so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source .
our bacteria can transform phthalates , which is a harmful toxin , into end products such as carbon dioxide , water and alcohol .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : when we drive , we get into a glass bubble , lock the doors and press the accelerator , relying on our eyes to guide us -- even though we can only see the few cars ahead of and behind us . but what if cars could share data with each other about their position and velocity , and use predictive models to calculate the safest routes for everyone on the road ? jennifer healey imagines a world without car accidents .
stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
good estimate he &apos;ll continue going 85 miles an hour .
and that &apos;s where the predictive model helps you .
so let your car gossip about you .
that &apos;s a terrible waste of calories .

my wife , yvonne , and i , we have four kids , three grown ones and a 15-year-old .
because i actually like kids .
i can predict school scores .
i was so disgusted i spent my money on this thing .
so that &apos;s just how this goes . jl : so how do you stick with them after they leave high school ?
so i grew up in east los angeles ,
you just had to do things sometimes .
and we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding , for support .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?
now , those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions ,
for example whether or not they have a college degree .
or at least , enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy .
maybe we &apos;ll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool ,

so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve .
well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in districts across the country on a project called measures of effective teaching .
so it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection .
an even more important benefit for our country .
why not strangers ?
whether it &apos;s our clothes , whether it &apos;s our cars , whether it &apos;s our bikes , whether it &apos;s our books or music , we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we &apos;ve never met .
how might we think differently about our relations with people ?
and they could -- i watched this woman for three days .
so his hands know and his intuition knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially

the fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nationality or race , none of that seems morally relevant to me .

one person who &apos;s thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will crouch .
i think it &apos;s clear what &apos;s the better thing to do .
you never get off , and you never really feel satisfied .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : in art school , phil hansen developed an unruly tremor in his hand that kept him from creating the pointillist drawings he loved . hansen was devastated , floating without a sense of purpose . until a neurologist made a simple suggestion : embrace this limitation ... and transcend it .
at the time , i was finishing up school , and i was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies .
or what if , instead of painting with a brush , i could only paint with karate chops ? so i &apos;d dip my hands in paint , and i just attacked the canvas , and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks .
i found myself in a state of constant creation , thinking only of what &apos;s next and coming up with more ideas than ever .
in 2008 , i was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years , and go out and get a job , and this happened .
there &apos;s bullying . we can &apos;t control them .

so to get to choosing eric chahi &apos;s wonderful another world , amongst others , we put together a panel of experts ,
you know , video games can be truly deep even when they &apos;re completely mindless .
and i was like , &quot; why ? &quot;
we &apos;re going to stay with them forever .
and are very useful to explain what interaction is .
i want it to keep flying .
sexual assault , domestic violence , relationship abuse , sexual harassment , sexual abuse of children .
how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject
so now mary &apos;s very identity -- mary is a battered woman -- is what was done to her by john in the first instance .
why do so many men rape other men ?
or , better yet , we can be heard saying some things that women often can &apos;t be heard saying .
and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation ,
in the end , what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends .
but you know what &apos;s missing ? the leadership .

i &apos;m going to try to request this toy , the rope toy , from the dolphins using the rope sound .
now , instead of pushing a keyboard through the water , the diver &apos;s wearing the complete system , and it &apos;s acoustic only ,

i did a little bit of research on this notion , and it might calm some folk down to know that the idea of a net guaranteed minimum income has been championed by those frothing-at-the-mouth socialists friedrich hayek , richard nixon and milton friedman .
the realities of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more widely known .
yet this is the kind of movie that i wanted to make ever since i was a kid , really ,
and robert is actually the very first example of how constraints can boost creativity .
guy was interested by this idea not because i was asking for his money , but because i came to him with a good idea in which everybody was happy .

it &apos;s sexist . it &apos;s heterosexist .
and when you show up to play baseball , nobody needs to talk about what we &apos;re going to do or how this baseball game might be good for us .
and you also can &apos;t get to second base and say , &quot; i like it here . i &apos;m going to stay here . &quot;

we can use mathematical models to estimate the force that i &apos;m applying to the quad .

i used to , to try to avoid homework , sneak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate heatedly .
but despite our electoral mandate , the markets mistrusted us .
instead , i had a very humbling experience .
so far , we &apos;ve thrown economics at the problem , actually mostly austerity , and certainly we could have designed alternatives , a different strategy , a green stimulus for green jobs , or mutualized debt , eurobonds which would support countries in need from market pressures ,
and i &apos;m not talking about the necessary reforms of the united nations or the g20 .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
i write fiction sci-fi thrillers ,
representative government began to form .
and in that situation , sifting through the wreckage of a suicide drone attack , it will be very difficult to say who sent that weapon .
now in a world of cheap , proliferating robotic weapons , borders would offer very little protection to critics of distant governments or trans-national criminal organizations .
but notice , this is more an immune system than a weapons system .
let me take you back two years ago in my life .
it was a punishment for daring to challenge the society &apos;s rules .

but the great recession in 2007 and 2008 , the great crash , broke this illusion .
and this process , which is absolutely non-linear -- cannot be predicted by standard techniques -- is the reflection of a collective emergent behavior which is fundamentally endogenous .
so this is now so successful that it is used in the initial phase of &#91; unclear &#93; the flight .
we all know the chinese miracle .
now , this is interesting .
but can we really slay the dragons ?
but i do have an idea , and that idea is called housing for health .
and it then connects them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good .
this is a big deal , so the ticks and crosses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
they don &apos;t work , we have to fix them .
and he came out and , within a day , it worked out that most dust in this community was within a meter of the ground , the wind-driven dust --
it was during the design of the first toilet that i went for lunch , invited by the family into their main room of the house .
people are not the problem .
the connectivity situation has improved greatly , but some barriers remain .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
we &apos;ve built a crowd map , we &apos;ve built ushahidi .
it is not without challenge .
i would wander the streets searching for food ,
when i could not fall asleep from bitter cold or hunger pains , i hoped that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
i went to america without knowing a word of english ,
i felt so suffocated that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of starvation .
my foster father didn &apos;t intend to change my life .
i just wanted to say thank you for letting me be in this world .
that is , he did none of the things that might make it easy to cry foul , to put down the whole story as a pious fable .
it has to be one of the multiple ironies of history that a favorite expletive of muslim fundamentalists is the same one once used by the christian fundamentalists known as crusaders : &quot; infidel , &quot; from the latin for &quot; faithless . &quot;
and i , for one , refuse to live that way .
in the northwest corner of the united states , right up near the canadian border , there &apos;s a little town called libby , montana ,
vermiculite was in the playground . it was in the football ground . it was in the skating rink .
this wasn &apos;t ignorance .
and some people are blind because they think , well , seeing anything is just futile .
and i &apos;ll never be the same . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .
she got diabetes . case closed .
more importantly , i don &apos;t have insulin resistance .
all of those immune cells rushing to the site of the injury to salvage cellular debris and prevent the spread of infection to elsewhere in the body .
i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but i &apos;m wide open to others .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignoring because we think we know the answer .

here i &apos;m one person talking to you .
but this is a worse one .
well , after 1977 , i broke into the new yorker and started selling cartoons .
what you have is the syntax of politeness and the message of being rude .
no . no . no . no . no . &#91; four hours later &#93; hey , that &apos;s good , yeah , whatcha got there ?
and if it &apos;s completely okay , what &apos;s the joke ? okay ?
that &apos;s a cartoon about terrorism .
it &apos;s 95 percent of the humor . it &apos;s not our humor .
it &apos;s called french army knife .
thank you .
we were taught that grand story day in and day out .
those who do not are doomed to fail .
now here are the facts .
in the larger central committee of 300 or more , the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller .
but merit remains the fundamental driver .
now , if this is not legitimacy , i &apos;m not sure what is .
in the next 10 years , china will surpass the u.s. and become the largest economy in the world .
bruno giussani : eric , stay with me for a couple of minutes , because i want to ask you a couple of questions .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 524687 &quot; &gt; els de keyser &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and part of the reason why we don &apos;t know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here .
but eventually that data , hopefully , gets typed into a computer , and someone can begin to analyze it ,
we can skip straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives . &quot;
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology ,
you can create forms , and once you &apos;ve created the forms , you push them to a variety of common mobile phones .
we &apos;ve made a lot of progress , but i recognize that right now , even the work that we &apos;ve done with 14,000 people using this is still a drop in the bucket .
and so people think of clouds as things that get in the way .
i think we should stand up for them , which is why , a few years ago , i started the cloud appreciation society .
all right . those are rarer clouds than the cirrus , but they &apos;re not that rare .
you &apos;re not going to change the world by lying on your back and gazing up at the sky , are you ?
and it will probably live up to its name .
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
the energy in all living things , atp , is phosphorus-based .
yes , it is . what is worse is that it is very expensive .
but we are indeed heading for a major crisis , and i ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
it grows much faster , and is much better designed to seek out phosphorus .
on the left side , you see the yield produced using conventional agriculture , with a 100 percent phosphorus dose .
&lt; / doc &gt;
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president abacha , and it just so happens he &apos;s a convicted money launderer too .
now , they &apos;re all people we &apos;ve investigated , and they &apos;re all people who couldn &apos;t do what they do alone .
and then there &apos;s the problem of anonymous shell companies .
and now forgive me , i &apos;m going to read the next bit because it &apos;s a very live issue , and our lawyers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 524687 &quot; &gt; els de keyser &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and that &apos;s true here in the united states .
and i think wood is going to be part of that solution , and i &apos;m going to tell you the story of why .
and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call fftt ,
in countries with deforestation issues ,
it just happens to be that mother nature holds the patent , and we don &apos;t really feel comfortable with it .
but also , it &apos;s extremely expensive , costing 800 dollars per test , and it &apos;s grossly inaccurate , missing 30 percent of all pancreatic cancers .
and so then , i was sitting in class , and suddenly it hit me : i could combine what i was reading about , carbon nanotubes ,
there were 20 ph.d.s , plus me and the professor crammed into this tiny office space ,

to me , this was a little like trying to understand the magnificence of beethoven &apos;s fifth symphony by abstracting the sound of a single violin player out of the context of the orchestra and hearing just that one part .
well , i &apos;ve returned to lincoln meadow 15 times in the last 25 years , and i can tell you that the biophony , the density and diversity of that biophony , has not yet returned to anything like it was before the operation .
the good news is that , with a little bit of habitat restoration and fewer flights , the frog populations , once diminishing during the 1980s and early &apos; 90s , have pretty much returned to normal .

except , all of those years i &apos;ve been there on a tourist visa ,
maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divisions of our grandparents &apos; age .
because it comes out of this almost unprecedented blend of cultures .
and as he had it , even the most restless , distractible , testosterone-addled 15-year-old californian boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him cooled down and cleared out .
and i started to go back to this place ,
especially when i hear president obama often talk about the korean education system as a benchmark of success .
i also researched extensively on bows around the world .
has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
today , their share has more than doubled to above 20 percent .
all of these have contributed to more and more income going to the very , very top .
there are superstar cooks and superstar farmers .
again , this is no mere hypothetical .
that means that our countries are getting richer , our companies are getting more efficient , but we &apos;re not creating more jobs and we &apos;re not paying people , as a whole , more .

and i came back home about four years later .
making it very cold , so at liquid helium temperatures ;
so what we do is we take conventional printing presses , we make conductive inks , and run those through a press , and basically just letting hundreds of thousands of electrons flow through pieces of paper
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
so i &apos;ve made some new technology ,
well , it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple , logical reason , namely , it &apos;s a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we &apos;re conscious .
and i &apos;m going to go through some of them .
but they think , &quot; well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an awful problem .
okay , that &apos;s the first feature of consciousness .
and that &apos;s how nature works . that &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to function causally .
or is it observer-relative ?
you &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
and the bitcoins are released , they &apos;re put into a public ledger called the blockchain ,
so obviously i &apos;m looking at this through a marketing prism , so from a brand perspective ,
it &apos;s infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals , so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive ,
so this currency becomes credit , which again , is really , really interesting .
francesca fedeli : ciao .

so , for example , if i was angry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very adept at concealing how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustrated .
they told me , for example , that if i proved myself worthy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been ,
but together , they forged a blend of courage , creativity , integrity , and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole .
in fact , one of the voices actually dictated the answers during the exam , which technically possibly counts as cheating .
we are unique . we are irreplaceable .
and as i sat in this temple square under this gigantic beringin banyan tree , in the dark , there was no electricity , just the full moon , down in this empty square , and i heard the most beautiful sounds , like a charles ives concert as i listened to the gamelan music from all the different villagers that came for this once-every-five-years ceremony . and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree .
i start with the notion of the ideograph .

so try this :
chris is a great friend of mine from my university days , but secretly , i hate him .
and when she said this , i had an epiphany .
in fact , in the years that i gathered data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
it &apos;s not just the way they look , but i love the way they feel when you press down on them .
the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative heritage .
and is used to write amharic , which is spoken by over 24 million people .
over here , you see a paleographic chart that shows what has been deciphered so far ,
and i think it was that excitement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was stirring , some sort of musical gift .
and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way .
those of you who can see will know how many notes , but derek , of course , can &apos;t .
so while we were waiting in the two hours before the rehearsal and the concert , derek listened to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the orchestra .
dp : let derek play it .
it &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected ,
because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
but over two million people cut trees .
it stayed there in taiwan as a permanent church even now .

extremely prophetic , by thomas dekker , another elizabethan dramatist .
if we flip the brain on its back -- i love this little bit of spinal cord here -- this bit here is the hypothalamus , and right under there is a whole raft of interesting structures , not least the biological clock .
now , i would say that a hot dog bun is kind of a meager return for such a complicated and demanding behavior as sleep .
so we &apos;re in the six-and-a-half-hours every-night league .
a biological mimic for sleep ,
so most of us , of course , ask the question , &quot; how do i know whether i &apos;m getting enough sleep ? &quot;
but sleep requirements do not go down . and the fourth myth is early to bed , early to rise makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise .
other work flowed from these studies .
thank you for your attention .
it was an exercise in democratic schooling ,
a number so beautiful , so massive , i think it will blow your mind .
but as soon as we go hunting for massive primes , we realize it &apos;s not enough just to put in any prime number in the power .

organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange , but at that time , even during my most vulnerable condition , i needed to dream big .
so we organized a five-kilometer united we run campaign .

what i do in my art is i skip the canvas altogether , and if i want to paint your portrait , i &apos;m painting it on you , physically on you .
and i &apos;d always had this dream of going to washington , d.c. , and sitting at a desk and working in government .
it was in constant flux , and we had to , rather than fight it , embrace it , see where the milk would take us and compensate to make it even better .
for years i &apos;ve been telling people , stress makes you sick . it increases the risk of everything from the common cold to cardiovascular disease .
and unbeknownst to you , the experimenter has been trained to harass you during it .
but in the study , when participants viewed their stress response as helpful , their blood vessels stayed relaxed like this .
it enhances your empathy .
and they started the study by asking , &quot; how much stress have you experienced in the last year ? &quot;
ca : thank you so much , kelly . it &apos;s pretty cool .
i &apos;m already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers ,
the deer started avoiding certain parts of the park , the places where they could be trapped most easily , particularly the valleys and the gorges ,
so that the rivers became more fixed in their course .
they tell us that when you take away the large animals , you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals .

the original designer of the memorial , michael arad , had this image in his mind of all the names appearing undifferentiated , almost random , really a poetic reflection on top of the nature of a terrorism event itself ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : months after he was born , in 1948 , ron mccallum became blind . in this charming , moving talk , he shows how he reads -- and celebrates the progression of clever tools and adaptive computer technologies that make it possible . with their help , and the help of volunteers , he &apos;s become a lawyer , an academic , and , most of all , a voracious reader . welcome to the blind reading revolution .
i was pretty good in reading , but religion and musical appreciation needed more work .
and i thought to myself , &quot; this thing &apos;s got a glass screen , not much use to me . &quot;

and i don &apos;t know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus , but i do know what it feels like when i have a virus , the flu , and i know how difficult it is for me to get to the grocery store to get good nutrition .
so the beauty of helping bees this way , for me , is that every one of us needs to behave a little bit more like a bee society , an insect society , where each of our individual actions can contribute to a grand solution , an emergent property , that &apos;s much greater than the mere sum of our individual actions .

what would you do ?
i study memory . i &apos;ve studied memory for decades .
and you might be thinking , well , you know ,
a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases ,
and i went through nearly five years of dealing with this messy , unpleasant litigation , but finally , finally , it was over and i could really get back to my work .
we can &apos;t reliably distinguish true memories from false memories .
it &apos;s a great pleasure and fascinating work and exciting to work with graduate students and post-docs and think up cool experiments to understand how this sense of smell works and how the brain might be working ,
so i thought , well , maybe i should teach a course on ignorance ,
the facts are important . you have to know a lot of stuff
what do we use this knowledge for ?
so yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist ,
if there &apos;s a real rose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no rose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
how do we do that ? well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
and that &apos;s a bad thing , because then you will get what you select for , which is what we &apos;ve gotten so far .
we &apos;ve gone from people who confronted a concrete world and analyzed that world primarily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confront a very complex world ,
if that martian looked at battlefields , they would find that people had only muskets at the time of the civil war at the time of the spanish-american war , and then they had machine guns
wherever there is always snow , the bears are white .
and you were supposed to think , well , the state legislature was rural-controlled ,
i take the farm manager of today as very different from the farmer of 1900 .
if you have a principle such as , people shouldn &apos;t suffer unless they &apos;re guilty of something , then to exclude black people you &apos;ve got to make exceptions , don &apos;t you ? you have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that .
and they &apos;re essentially ahistorical .
for a long time in my life , i felt like i &apos;d been living two different lives .
we don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
i feared my truth , i feared my honesty , i feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner ,
and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
you &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
and connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the shephelah , which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west ,
and saul says , &quot; you can &apos;t fight him . that &apos;s ridiculous .
well , we call him an underdog because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and goliath is this big , strong giant .
if you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
secondly , the bible story makes special note of how slowly goliath moves , another odd thing to say when you &apos;re describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point .
there &apos;s even speculation that abraham lincoln had acromegaly .

so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carries you to your ancestral resting place .

people ask me if i &apos;m frightened or repulsed by participating in a culture where the physical manifestations of death greet us at every turn .
so my name is amy webb , and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came burning down in a spectacular fashion .
i figure i &apos;m attracted to maybe one out of 10 of those men ,

see , the real problem here is that , while the algorithms work just fine , you and i don &apos;t , when confronted with blank windows where we &apos;re supposed to input our information online .

over the past three decades , we have lived through a quiet revolution .
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
you &apos;d measure how many -- el : how many books they read and how many books they continued to read after you stopped paying them .
and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practices we prize ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1837 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and rightly so , in many cases .
we can show results . we can make things better .
the resources are overwhelmingly generated by business .
that thinking has led to , i think , much of the behavior that we have come to criticize in business , that i come to criticize in business .
we see companies like the brazilian forestry company fibria that &apos;s figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp
i know it . i &apos;m seeing it .
mayor bloomberg recognized this when he launched planyc in 2007 .
it was dangerous , hard to cross the street .
all the people arrived .
and in the three years since we &apos;ve implemented the project , retail sales have increased 172 percent .
we protected bikers by floating parking lanes ,
the high that we &apos;ve had so far is 44,000 in august .
you just need to reimagine your streets .
and a third returned to historic palestine , did the second rebuilding of the temple in jerusalem , financed , incidentally , by persian tax money .
ironically , this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in peacemaking with washington than to see to israel &apos;s destruction .
iran is germany , and ahmadinejad is hitler .
following three years of work in somalia , i got picked up by the world health organization , and got assigned to the epidemics of aids .
we who had worked in behavior knew that punishment was something that was discussed but also that it was highly overvalued .
and so we see that violence is , in a way , behaving like a contagious disease .
just like t.b. , but the object is behavior change .
my musician friends added the word &quot; dude . &quot;
thank you .
now , i know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; well actually , this is hard to grasp , &quot; because private capitalism and liberal democracy
they have vastly different political systems and different economic systems ,
the evidence around illiberal democracies is quite depressing .
at its very best , the western model speaks for itself .

imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage , it goes underwater , and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you &apos;re doing .
actually , oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states ,
and we finally have the studies , one in britain called &quot; gluttony versus sloth &quot;
and it &apos;s almost all coming from car exhaust .
to become more environmental , we move into the country , we commune with nature , we build suburbs .
we &apos;ve got the solar photovoltaic system , solar hot water heater , dual-flush toilets , bamboo floors .
and that &apos;s living in a walkable neighborhood .
and i think in many ways we can sort of think of the use of the blue nacre shell and the mayans as the first real application of the bluetooth technology .
every day to eat his liver .
so in this picture , you can see the middle of the leg , so the bone marrow , then you can see the original bone , and you can see where that original bone finishes , and just to the left of that is the new bone that &apos;s grown within that bioreactor cavity ,
we zoom in , we can see , even if you don &apos;t know anything about bone structure , it &apos;s beautifully organized , really beautifully organized .

there &apos;s only one little entrance to the entire building , and the 3,000 residents come in and out through that single door .
from the main dock , people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area .
while to most of us , living amongst these piles and piles of garbage may seem totally uninhabitable , to those in the zabbaleen , this is just a different type of normal .
through this architecture by subtraction , these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil .
i sat down next to a stout , middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie ,
and for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
this time it &apos;s on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that i &apos;ve never met before tells me that terence is dying , perhaps tonight .

we have a noble path to curing the disease , patients and doctors alike , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be a noble path to dying .
it &apos;s a feature .
we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a webcam ,
in another experiment , we presented to our subjects information about a potential job candidate .
now the problem is that the current policy mechanisms we have to protect ourselves from the abuses of personal information are like bringing a knife to a gunfight .
when someone tells you that privacy is incompatible with the benefits of big data , consider that in the last 20 years , researchers have created technologies to allow virtually any electronic transactions to take place in a more privacy-preserving manner .
however , in the book , he also offers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden .
it felt a bit girly to me , like a dress , and it had this baggy trouser part you had to tie really tight to avoid the embarrassment of them falling down .
but then very quickly , i started to underestimate my mustache growing ability , and it got way too big .
every time i fail to become bruce lee , i become more authentically me .
we &apos;re not heading towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees , we &apos;re heading toward six degrees .
we know from asking people from china to the u.s. that the vast majority of people care about sustainability after the day-to-day issues , the day-to-day issues of , how do i get my kids to school ?
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old incandescent .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we put through our business .
and this came in ikea actually in the &apos; 90s .
and we &apos;ll do whatever it takes to lead the change .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : the past decade has seen slow and steady economic growth across the continent of africa . but economist charles robertson has a bold thesis : africa &apos;s about to boom . he talks through a few of the indicators -- from rising education levels to expanded global investment -- that lead him to predict rapid growth for a billion people , sooner than you may think .
the private sector as well .
so where do you set up your new factory ?
strong democracies are the orange color .
every rich country is relatively uncorrupt .
it grew at two percent when population growth was about two and a half .

we were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the higgs boson .
besides the known higgs state , there could be a second state in which the higgs field is billions and billions times denser than what we observe today ,
and experiments at the lhc found that the mass of the higgs boson is about 126 gev .
and indeed , a possible answer to my question opens up new universes , literally .
but whichever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surprises .
and yet here we were , obsessed about being wired .
our own emotions and state of mind often encode time , regret or nostalgia about the past , hope or dread about the future .
this digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with twitter streams that are already trending and news from other time zones .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
i wanted to learn to cook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cubing and chopping for a whole month .
and frantic . my god .
as one woman put it to a soldier who was trying to evacuate her for a second time , &quot; shoot me and dig the grave .
and there is a kind of heroic resilience , a kind of plain-spoken pragmatism to those who start their day at 5 a.m. pulling water from a well and end it at midnight poised to beat a bucket with a stick and scare off wild boar that might mess with their potatoes ,
what sounds like faith , soft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth -- i mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who returned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radioactive land on earth for the last 27 years , have actually outlived their counterparts who accepted relocation , by some estimates up to 10 years .
chris addressed us , the scientists and experts , &quot; you have to be more pragmatic .
the transmission is interrupted . the engine is turned off .
the robot is transparent , just like you would hold a young child during the first insecure steps .
and here , you can see one such example , where we label the fibers coming from the brain in red .
maybe even without pharmacology or stimulation .
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u.s. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
if the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting , and they have leads and they have suspects , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect &apos;s phone , and to intercept his internet communications .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do ,
and these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this gchq intelligence agency from the united kingdom targeting a telecom here in belgium .
you shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . it &apos;s about privacy .
but maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone . maybe you can do it together with other countries .
now these numbers can be appreciated in many different ways .
now look at those numbers .
now , if we continue this process , we &apos;ll generate rectangles of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
stepping onto the sidewalk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete sidewalk in front of me .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complications from brain surgery .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
but one time i was in oakland

our banks began to fail .
and there we were .

and on that day , 150,000 visits were placed to our website .
really a redesign , rethinking the way we build our infrastructure ,
the grandchildren are coming home .
so the first thing we need is more thumbs .
stand up ! it &apos;s easier if you stand up .
so you used creativity . that was great .
how many of you won just won thumb ?
what some of us may not realize is that in the himalayan foothills , where the climate is much warmer and the landscape much greener , there lives a great diversity of wildlife , including the one-horned rhinoceros , the asian elephant and the bengal tiger .
sometimes , we fly the drone in a lawnmower-type pattern and take pictures of that area ,
because we want to keep track of the health of these habitats .
we also work with collaborators to discover new ways of using these drones .
this drone can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes , which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers .
so with this focus on cost-cutting , i asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent ,
very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer ,
now , if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average oecd , it would save the american people 500 billion u.s. dollars a year .
that &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .

it may look like a plane with a fancy paint job , but i packed it with over 1,000 kilos of high-tech sensors , computers , and a very motivated staff of earth scientists and pilots .
but they &apos;re doing it on landscapes that are hardly known to science . if you don &apos;t know where the carbon is exactly , in detail , how can you know what you &apos;re losing ?
the amazon was so dry in 2010 that even the main stem of the amazon river itself dried up partially , as you see in the photo in the lower portion of the slide .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : paralyzed by a stroke , henry evans uses a telepresence robot to take the stage and show how new robotics , tweaked and personalized by a group called robots for humanity , help him live his life to the full . he shows off a nimble little quadrotor drone , created by a team led by chad jenkins , that gives him the ability to once again stroll a garden , visit a campus or give a tedx talk .
i can surf the web , exchange email with people ,
i went even further by seeing if i could use a head-mounted display , the oculus rift , as modified by fighting walrus , to have an immersive experience controlling the drone .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
imagine you are in a maternity ward in mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
the ground stations are located on safe locations
compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
in the developed world and the emerging world , we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable .
ourselves . most old people in the u.s. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years ,
still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , baskets , pots and textiles .
there have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it ,
the lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern american society .
so yesterday , i was out in the street in front of this building ,
so here &apos;s the words : tree , highway , mirror , saturn and electrode .
it &apos;s limited in capacity , limited in duration ,
it &apos;s a way of processing what &apos;s going on so that we can use it later .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a sheet of paper that has an organizational chart on it or has some guiding images ,
if all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different sizes , larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains , and the larger the brain , the more cognitively able its owner should be .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
so this brings us to a very important conclusion already , which is that we are not rodents . the human brain is not a large rat brain .
and we looked for the combinations of body size and number of brain neurons that a primate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cerebral cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simplest explanation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
when you are happy , you are grateful . but think again .
something that &apos;s really valuable to me and i realize it &apos;s freely given , then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart ,
and if you miss the opportunity of this moment , another moment is given to us , and another moment .
to learn , to suffer , to stand up , all these opportunities are given to us ,
and every time i turned it on , water .
it can change our world in immensely important ways ,
and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same , stop , look , go .
the idea is called the social impact bond .

well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
they &apos;ve tried many different approaches .
they stick , and then they try to go into the lung side from blood channel .
now we can begin to create models of diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome .
we could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other deadly diseases such as sars .
like the prototype you see there , put the cartridge into the machine just like you would a c.d. , and away you go .
i debate people who literally want to obliterate everything i believe in , in some cases , who don &apos;t want me and people like me to even exist .
in other words , we can be politically right but emotionally wrong .
but he &apos;s listening , not because of what i said , but because of how i said it , and somehow , even though we &apos;ve never met , we &apos;ve managed to form a connection .
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
if more money is invested in highways , of course there is less money for housing , for schools , for hospitals ,
a committee of 12-year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scarce road space is with exclusive lanes for buses .
they are a right , just as sidewalks are , unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mobility , without the risk of getting killed .
they could go for dozens of kilometers safely without any risk in wonderful greenways , sort of bicycle highways , and i would invite you to imagine the following : a city in which every other street would be a street only for pedestrians and bicycles .
they can create a much happier life for billions towards the future .
we are more dependent on it now than ever .
they don &apos;t have time to relax .
in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile , it emits about a thousandth of aviation and about a tenth of trucking .
i &apos;d been well treated by the crew , i &apos;d had a garrulous and entertaining captain , and i would happily have signed up for another five weeks ,
but my father wanted me to learn how to read and write .
my people build all the time with clay , but they don &apos;t see any innovation with mud .
with my team , and it works .
i came to speak to you like that .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every holiday to gando .
the second most exciting thing for a cave explorer is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .

but it was a defining time for me as a young boy .
and then one day we were out together , and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked .
it &apos;s shaking me violently .
this is the other thing about solly , he &apos;s freakishly strong .
and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her herd .
but i just wondered if you wanted to share any additional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this session .
i do . i was a young boy , and my grandfather had just died ,
and the phrase i heard most often was that granddad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if i should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then i too would go up there ,
twice as likely .
but betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir and staying alive forever is a risky strategy .
and the pursuit of fame is as widespread and popular now as it ever was ,
now , i find it helps to see life as being like a book :
as it had topped the list of american shrinking cities .
that are living in midwestern cities like detroit .
so if we take all of that vacant and abandoned property and we smush it together , it looks like about 20 square miles ,
now we have community stewardship happening in neighborhoods , we have cultural entrepreneurs making decisions to move to the city and create enterprises , and we have businesses relocating ,
and actually acquire property so they were actually property owners as well as business owners in the communities with which they resided .
so today , i &apos;m here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now .
it &apos;s a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automatically when we need it without having to look for it .
that seems trivial , but it &apos;s less time spent caring for patients .
imagine a field engineer arriving at the wind farm with a handheld device telling her which turbines need servicing .
there are people who argue that today &apos;s innovation is all about social media and silly games , with nowhere near the transformational power of the industrial revolution .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and the reality is that if you don &apos;t have much money , like this young named kamal right here , the option you really have is a bamboo staff to get around .
regardless of your income level , you want the most beautiful , the best product that there is .
so this is it right here .
because if you want to scale , if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a knee , it needs to be economically sustainable .

dr. rudy leibel of columbia university has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
even if they started at a normal weight ,
i &apos;m not saying you need to learn to meditate
even at its best , dieting is a waste of time and energy .
now , my dad &apos;s doing better today ,
in other words , are the side effects just so severe that no matter how much good it does , it &apos;s not going to be worth it ?
so we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one .
but it wasn &apos;t until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some traction .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1902 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;

so let &apos;s start with the first one , this immunogenicity idea .
however , you still don &apos;t really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sleeves up and vaccinate and wait .
now , of course , we &apos;ve worked within my lab with many other vaccines that have attained similar responses and similar curves to this , what we &apos;ve achieved with influenza .
yet , that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it &apos;s too expensive .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
my husband read it and he was like , this is like eating your wheaties .
ss : i mean , i &apos;m grateful , i &apos;m honored , i &apos;m happy , and it &apos;s the very beginning .

you know , from healthcare to transportation , everything is different , but education hasn &apos;t changed .
now these large numbers are just one part of the story .
but what if we embraced technology , embraced the millennial generation &apos;s natural predilections , and really think about creating these online technologies , blend them into their lives .
and this is a form of learning called active learning ,
we can do this through online labs and use computing power to build these online labs .
the business aspect .
so i have a brother , gavin .
i was getting interviewed by all these national news outlets and press outlets , and it was amazing .
come on , say it with me . one , two , three : haters gonna hate .
complex systems have many interacting parts which behave according to simple , individual rules , and this results in emergent properties .
so we took er-1 to the evaluation room .
so these bats remember their friends for a really long time .
there is one dominant pair , and many subordinates , some acting as sentinels , some acting as babysitters , some teaching pups , and so on .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : we &apos;re all familiar with satellite imagery , but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date . that &apos;s because satellites are big and expensive , so there aren &apos;t that many of them up in space . as he explains in this fascinating talk , dan berkenstock and his team came up with a different solution , designing a cheap , lightweight satellite with a radically new approach to photographing what &apos;s going on on earth .
which are now operated by private companies and from which the vast majority of satellite imagery that you and i see on a daily basis comes .

in fact , traditional assessments like narrow 360 surveys or outdated performance criteria will give you false positives , lulling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are .
they &apos;re often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a courageous leap .

and the other , even better , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s america .
but the fun doesn &apos;t have to end there , maybe you want to be even more anonymous .
but this was an awful tragedy , and it shouldn &apos;t have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths .
there is such an opportunity right now .

and then about 30 seconds before launch , the vehicle is completely alive -- it is ready to go -- the apus are running , the computers are all self-contained ,
and having the goal in mind , thinking about where it might lead , directed me to a life of looking at all of the small details to allow this to become possible , to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million-pound creation that &apos;s going around the world at five miles a second , eight kilometers a second ,
and so a spider lands on you , and you go through this great , spasmy attack because spiders are scary .
so when you finally actually get outside on a spacewalk , it feels much different than it would if you just went out first time .
the only part that survives is the little bullet that we &apos;re riding in , and it falls into the atmosphere ,
richard ledgett : the nsa responds to edward snowden ’ s ted talk
rl : he absolutely did have alternative ways that he could have gone ,
ca : can you give a specific example of how he put people &apos;s lives at risk ?
so nsa has two missions .
and i think that &apos;s part of the reason that this has been so revelational and so sensational in the media .
that says , when you find that , not if you find it , when you find it , because you &apos;re certain to find it , here &apos;s how you protect that .
so metadata , in that sense , actually is privacy-enhancing .
you had a follow-on a week later to a qatari company .
and there have been a dozen threats where that was implicated .
ca : and yet , when congressmen discovered what was actually being done with that authorization , many of them were completely shocked .

ca : rick , when ed snowden ended his talk , i offered him the chance to share an idea worth spreading .

the shrimp are just one step on its journey .
their world is one of plot twists and unexpected explanations .
this is ampulex compressa , the emerald cockroach wasp , and it is a truth universally acknowledged that an emerald cockroach wasp in possession of some fertilized eggs must be in want of a cockroach .
if there are any , this is a good candidate for them .
and while that idea may be disquieting , and while parasites &apos; habits may be very grisly , i think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin .
as scientists , we use that to help the way people interact online ,
so how is it that one of the strongest indicators of your intelligence is liking this page when the content is totally irrelevant to the attribute that &apos;s being predicted ?

ted talk subtitles and transcript : in 1993 , bill and melinda gates took a walk on the beach and made a big decision : to give their microsoft wealth back to society . in conversation with chris anderson , the couple talks about their work at the bill &amp; amp ; melinda gates foundation , as well as their marriage , their children , their failures and the satisfaction of giving most of their money away .
were there things that weren &apos;t being done ?
and so we picked those two things , and everything the foundation does is focused there .
and to me that was just a crime , and i kept looking around trying to find the person that would get this back on the global stage ,
it &apos;s not reported .
that just wouldn &apos;t work out . &quot;

thank you so much for coming to ted and for sharing with us and for all you do .
the reality is , the folks i described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms .
so why does teacher education only give you theory and theory and tell you about standards and tell you about all of these things that have nothing to do with the basic skills , that magic that you need to engage an audience , to engage a student ?

you had to make another step of courage too , because here was congress deadlocked again , and you got out of the rehabilitation center , got yourself to washington so that you could walk on the floor of the house -- i can barely talk about this without getting emotional — and cast a vote which could have been the deciding vote .

adam ii wants to hear a calling and obey the world .
through history , people have gone back into their own pasts , sometimes to a precious time in their life , to their childhood , and often , the mind gravitates in the past to a moment of shame , some sin committed , some act of selfishness , an act of omission , of shallowness , the sin of anger , the sin of self-pity , trying to be a people-pleaser , a lack of courage .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : the parenting section of the bookstore is overwhelming — it &apos;s &quot; a giant , candy-colored monument to our collective panic , &quot; as writer jennifer senior puts it . why is parenthood filled with so much anxiety ? because the goal of modern , middle-class parents — to raise happy children — is so elusive . in this honest talk , she offers some kinder and more achievable aims .
last year , i spoke with a researcher named matthew killingsworth who is doing a very , very imaginative project that tracks people &apos;s happiness ,
once kids stopped working , the economics of parenting changed .
i pay my taxes .

you don &apos;t have to believe in a god per se , just in being jewish . &quot; so if this guy is a rabbi , and a jewish rabbi , and if you have to believe in god in order to be religious , then we have the rather counterintuitive conclusion
i think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore crude and contentious .
of a set of assumptions that were religious , christian assumptions. of the natural world that didn &apos;t say something about its relationship , for example , to the creation story in the abrahamic tradition , the creation story in the first book of the torah .

in fact , they would contrast science with faith ,
according to the standard model , the textbook model , scientists develop hypotheses , they deduce the consequences of those hypotheses , and then they go out into the world and they say , &quot; okay , well are those consequences true ? &quot;
it &apos;s just not true . and i &apos;m going to talk about three reasons why it &apos;s wrong .
the first was an assumption about the size of the earth &apos;s orbit .
one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things .
and the answer is a model that includes , it &apos;s the answer e on that sat , all of the above .
but this leads us to one final problem : if science is what scientists say it is , then isn &apos;t that just an appeal to authority ?
our trust in science , like science itself , should be based on evidence , and that means that scientists have to become better communicators .
i remember one day , i said to her , &quot; it &apos;s october 1 today , &quot;

and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes heated conversations .

we set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education ,
this way , we open our students &apos; minds , we develop a positive shift in attitude toward different cultures .
from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right , affordable and accessible for all .
and now clathrin is basically done with its job , and so proteins are coming in now — we &apos;ve covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage .
it can change the way that we communicate with one another , how we explore our data and how we teach our students .
it might seem curious given that i spend a lot of my life on the stage .
when i was singing a lot of jazz , i worked a lot with a pianist whose name was steve .

as a statistician , i want people to show me the data so i can decide for myself .
dude , you &apos;re talking chances ,
i had this temperature data , and it told a different story .
here &apos;s a chart that we had about three or four years ago .
and so by collecting this data you can find out information about your thyroid .

maybe finally , we will earn our title : a department of corrections .

we don &apos;t like to talk about power .
virally , in the way that the tea party , for instance , was able to take the &quot; don &apos;t tread on me &quot; flag from the american revolution ,
think about the city where you live , where you &apos;re from .
could you put into practice effectively what it is that you know ?
and i want to invite you in particular to try a simple exercise drawn from the early frameworks of this curriculum .

but any of you in relationships — at least this is my case — just because you ask someone that you &apos;re with or your parent or your child how they feel doesn &apos;t mean that they can tell you .

canine veterans of conflicts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what &apos;s considered canine ptsd ,

the truth is , the end to this problem begins with us .
why our universe is continuing to expand , and what is this mysterious dark energy that drives that expansion ?
the hubble space telescope : for the last 25 years it &apos;s been producing some of the most detailed views of our distant universe , but if you tried to use the hubble to create an image of the sky , it would take 13 million individual images ,
but the systems we &apos;re finding aren &apos;t much like our own solar system ,
now , distance and changes in our universe — distance equates to time , as well as changes on the sky .
they all are consistent with the 42 points , but the ideas behind these lines are dramatically different .

jim holt : why does the universe exist ?
but for leibniz , who asked why is there something rather than nothing , this was not a great mystery .
if we let our desires melt away , we &apos;ll see the world for what it truly is , a vacuity , nothingness ,
they don &apos;t exist outside the world .
so we have this vastly rich multiverse that encompasses every logical possibility .
the fullest possible reality , that &apos;s special .
if you can compute it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of alleles and so forth , and a back-of-the-envelope calculation will tell you there are about 10 to the 10,000th possible humans , genetically .

i feared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him .
to that end , bageye and his friends , mostly jamaican , exhibited a kind of jamaican bella figura : turn your best side to the world , show your best face to the world .

you can actually see it in this video here .
we &apos;ve labeled the blood vessels in red , and the csf that &apos;s surrounding the brain will be in green .
and while it &apos;s important to point out that these studies don &apos;t prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause alzheimer &apos;s disease , they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta may contribute to the development of conditions like alzheimer &apos;s .
and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many .
but , we also must admit that we haven &apos;t been good at using those same networks and technologies to successfully articulate an alternative to what we &apos;re seeing and find the consensus and build the alliances that are needed to make it happen .
it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our representatives were voting in congress .
so , even if that wasn &apos;t enough to win a seat in congress , it was enough for us to become part of the conversation , to the extent that next month , congress , as an institution , is launching for the first time in argentina &apos;s history , a democracyos to discuss , with the citizens , three pieces of legislation : two on urban transportation and one on the use of public space .

the very same eric schmidt , the ceo of google , ordered his employees at google to cease speaking with the online internet magazine cnet after cnet published an article full of personal , private information about eric schmidt , which it obtained exclusively through google searches and using other google products . this same division can be seen with the ceo of facebook , mark zuckerberg , who in an infamous interview in 2010 pronounced that privacy is no longer a &quot; social norm . &quot;
that has been recognized in social science and in literature and in religion and in virtually every field of discipline .
the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy , the only people who will seek out privacy , are by definition bad people .
bg : i &apos;m curious about your relationship with ed snowden , because you have spoken with him a lot , and you certainly continue doing so , but in your book , you never call him edward , nor ed , you say &quot; snowden . &quot; how come ?

i think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health intervention .
children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .

without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .

if we can have a camera here so you can see my screen .
that is , at stage 3 or 4 , and i believe that is too late .
but there &apos;s one question that always seems to me to be most revealing , and that is : what did you take ?
i took this picture of this little girl .
every day , on average , by the end of this day , 32,000 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes — 32,000 people .

he never lost consciousness . rather , he watched from within as his body shut down , limb by limb , muscle by muscle .
his bedside became a site for those seeking advice and spiritual counsel , and through us , my father was able to speak and uplift , letter by letter , blink by blink .

as he says , &quot; i &apos;m living in a broken world , and there is holy work to do . &quot;
we &apos;re constantly bombarded with stories about how much data there is in the world , but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpreting it , size isn &apos;t everything .

the senate comes and says , &quot; uh-uh ,
the first thing they need to do is they need to create prosperity for the continent .
they need to build these institutions such that we are never held to ransom again by a few individuals like robert mugabe .
but what we &apos;re doing is just one group of institutions .
and it &apos;s only now , with more evidence and new technology that it &apos;s possible to make this a model for delivering aid .
what if , instead , we use technology to put cash , whether from aid agencies or from any one of us directly into a poor person &apos;s hands .
of course , giving cash won &apos;t create public goods like eradicating disease or building strong institutions ,
but until we can go there , i think the oceans still hold quite a few secrets .

so how do we know these trees worked ?
their conversations were about what their family was going to be like , what their kids &apos; names would be , how their life would be when they left the guerrilla .
&quot; yeah , right , if he doesn &apos;t do that , he &apos;s going to get killed . &quot;
when i get out of this , am i going to be rejected ? &quot; so the past christmas , what we did was we asked -- we found 27 mothers of guerrillas , and we asked them to give us pictures of their children , when they only could recognize themselves , so as not to put their lives in danger ,

and we made individual designs for every single house on the avenue that we painted , and we made these designs together with the local store owners , the building owners , and a team of about a dozen young men and women .
because these communities are informal — this was the inspiration — and in a communal effort , together with the people , you can almost work like in an orchestra , where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony .

and maybe the pharmaceutical companies should be working harder to develop more antibiotics .
there are clean energy subsidies , which are to switch to fuels which don &apos;t pollute as much or perhaps don &apos;t need fossil fuels .
but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics , they &apos;re nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs , which might save a patient &apos;s life only for a few months or perhaps a year , whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient &apos;s life forever .
and we need to completely rethink how we &apos;re going to use measures to control biological organisms , and rethink how we incentivize the development , introduction , in the case of antibiotics prescription , and use of these valuable resources .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : the term gross domestic product is often talked about as if it were “ handed down from god on tablets of stone . ” but this concept was invented by an economist in the 1930s . we need a more effective measurement tool to match 21st century needs , says michael green : the social progress index . with charm and wit , he shows how this tool measures societies across the three dimensions that actually matter . and reveals the dramatic reordering of nations that occurs when you use it .
but his message was clear : gdp is a tool to help us measure economic performance .
there have , of course , been efforts in the past to move beyond gdp .
what i &apos;ve done here is put on the vertical axis social progress .
go , brazil !
let &apos;s say that brazil adopts a bold economic plan to double gdp in the next decade .

and now , as i sit in my seat i only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day , my dreams , my children at school ,
and while we weren &apos;t sequencing genomes or building space telescopes , this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn &apos;t been done before .
dropping multiple , pre-positioned depots of food and fuel through which scott &apos;s final team of five would travel to the pole , where they would turn around and ski back to the coast again on foot .
we didn &apos;t see a sunset either .
i think it &apos;s a marvelous thing that humans can exist 365 days of the year with hamburgers and hot showers and movie theaters , but it does seem to produce a lot of empty cardboard boxes .
and then we ran out of food completely ,
one of shackleton &apos;s men described crossing this sort of terrain as like walking over the glass roof of a railway station .
right now , i am very happy just recovering and in front of hotel buffets .
now , what about labor demand ?
now , to tell the truth , in reality , the situation will be even more challenging .
and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 2030 .
and the top choice worldwide is the u.s .
workforce planning will become more important than financial planning .
now , to be clear , north american zoos are staffed by highly qualified , board-certified veterinarians who take outstanding care of their animal patients .
i feel that tug of human exceptionalism , even as i recognize the scientifically isolating cost of seeing ourselves as a superior species , apart .
but veterinarians have devised an intervention to deal with this foal rejection syndrome

it gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them , in silence , while they look back at me .
not the way we look , but the way we are .

wow . brilliant idea , except
and another funny thing :
and nrk rolled all its equipment on board a ship , and 200 meters out of the shore , transmitting the signal back ,
and with some very creative solutions .
you can see the famous trollfjord and a day after , all-time high for nrk2 .
in fact , nothing counts , and death is coming for us all . th : exactly . so why does this stand out ?
when people smile , it might be a very good slow idea ,
but more than that , increasingly , local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for wrongdoing , but of every plate that passes them by ,
history has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data , tracking the movements of innocent people , it gets abused , maybe for blackmail , maybe for political advantage , or maybe for simple voyeurism .
under armour , you may have heard of , is a baltimore company ,
it &apos;s something that we choose to do , and we could choose not to do it ,
or one evening when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community ,
i was going to do something , anything , to stop it .
we had no idea a big opposition was coming to us .
and they &apos;d be like , &quot; our husbands beat us . &quot;
because they can do it and we can &apos;t .
which would be an easy place for them to give trainings , use it as a farmer school , even as a marketplace , and anything they want to use it for ,
kb : do people here believe that i &apos;m at an age where i &apos;m supposed to be a grandmother in my village ?
kb : definitely . we are looking for as many people as we can , because now that the foundation &apos;s in the beginning process ,
i &apos;d like to think that &apos;s why mathematicians don &apos;t really bother going on nights out anymore .
nobody thinks that she &apos;s ugly , but she &apos;s not a supermodel , either .
so let &apos;s imagine then that you &apos;re a roaring success on the dating scene .
but then imagine , the next person to come along is just marginally less boring , dull and terrible than everybody that you &apos;ve seen before .
but what gottman and his team found was that one of the most important predictors for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced was how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation .
but i hope that aside from their use as tips , they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics .
so in the following week , i was back in the streets , but that time , i wasn &apos;t a member of any media outlet anymore .
but then something happened , something that wasn &apos;t predicted , that no one could have anticipated .
we are not competing for news .
but there &apos;s something more significant here , something that i believe is more important and more crucial than my personal example .
they said things like , &quot; i love a challenge , &quot; or , &quot; you know , i was hoping this would be informative . &quot;
their biggest goal is getting the next a or the next test score ?
and they &apos;ve done so poorly for so long that many people think it &apos;s inevitable .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : in this fun , short talk from tedyouth , lexicographer erin mckean encourages — nay , cheerleads — her audience to create new words when the existing ones won ’ t quite do . she lists out 6 ways to make new words in english , from compounding to “ verbing , ” in order to make language better at expressing what we mean , and to create more ways for us to understand one another .
so we &apos;ve been talking about this for a long time .
we usually take words for things that we like , like delicious food .
and of course , you can &quot; green &quot; things .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and you know , presumably he &apos;s wearing makeup , the lighting here is kind of challenging , but still , just from the video , we &apos;re able to extract his pulse and show it quite well .
it &apos;s very simple to use .
but it turns out that sound also produces visual motions .
and just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here , a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer .
this is our team .
so let &apos;s talk about why saving whales is critical to the resiliency of the oceans .
thank you .
and therefore , i decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people .
this is not a photo profile for your facebook .
i just remember a feeling of surprise ; surprise at finding a street with no cars , as opposed to the nearby mass . ave. full of cars ;
einstein once said , &quot; logic will get you from a to b .
walk the path through the park , not through the car park , and you have an entirely different path .
that you &apos;re really close to the beach .
and create another system . breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system under which they &apos;ve learned to respond .
not only did they write a book , but they also bound it themselves .

and then we have about 40,000 others , the missing , the ones we &apos;re still looking for today .
most of these crimes happened 32 years ago .

it began for me at the age of 11 .
it was desperately cold again .
that took eight years , and i &apos;m so proud of it because we recycled all of it back here in south america .
it won &apos;t make financial sense ,
&quot; if you can do , or dream you can , begin it now ,
if we had to boil water to get the same effect as evapotranspiration , we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world .
so at this moment -- this is 2003 , 2004 -- i happened to be coming to work in the government .
so in the last 10 years , deforestation came down in brazil 75 percent .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
now we need to go down to 10 by 2050 .
thank you .
today we made a big step forward . &quot;
they don &apos;t speak the same language .
then , of course , there &apos;s the struggle for life , the survival of the fittest , social darwinism .
so some psychologists said , when i tell them i run 140 humanitarian projects in the himalayas that give me so much joy , they said , &quot; oh , i see , you work for the warm glow .
two thousand years of contemplative study said yes , it is .
so now where do we go from there ?
sustainable harmony means now we will reduce inequality .

so that is a pitiable state of affairs .
sanitation is more about dignity than about human disposal of waste .
before we started , there were , as usual , more than 80 percent of people suffering from waterborne diseases .
severine autesserre : to solve mass violence , look to locals
but today i want to tell you a different story .
throughout the world , and throughout conflict zones , this common culture shapes the intervener &apos;s understanding of the causes of violence as something that is primarily located in the national and international spheres . it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
for instance , the very identity of the united nations as this macro-level diplomatic organization would be upended if it were to refocus on local conflicts .
it &apos;s with programs like this that we can help people like isabelle and her husband .
and voila , that picture went viral and broke the censorship and forced mass media to cover it .
and this raises a question : as digital technology makes things easier for movements , why haven &apos;t successful outcomes become more likely as well ?
they had to meet almost all the time to keep this carpool going .
it &apos;s in that capacity to work together , think together collectively , which can only be built over time with a lot of work .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge hobbles , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are crucial .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
the leaders listened . they turned the tables .
msf rapidly set up an ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
not only did this virus continue in the places where they &apos;d already become infected , but then it started to escalate and we saw the case numbers that you see here , something we &apos;d never seen before on such a scale , an exponential increase of ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spreading further and deeper into these countries .
and then we &apos;ve got to be able to have systems that can find every single case , every contact of those cases , and begin to track the transmission chains so that you can stop transmission .
what we saw , ladies and gentlemen , which was probably most impressive , was this incredible work by the governments , by the leaders in these countries , with the communities , to try to ensure people understood this disease , understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop ebola .
but it will only finish if those countries have got enough epidemiologists , enough health workers , enough logisticians and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases , track their contacts and make sure that this disease stops once and for all .
and women share the same distribution as well , but actually there &apos;s quite a big difference .
if you think they &apos;re fighting , you &apos;re a bit more of a nasty , aggressive person .
learning styles are made up and are not supported by scientific evidence .
which kind of makes sense because your brain controls the opposite hands , so left-handed people , the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the left-hand side of the brain ,
and in every single culture across the globe , men placed more value on physical attractiveness in a partner than did women , and in every single culture , too , women placed more importance than did men on ambition and high earning power . in every culture , too , men preferred women who were younger than themselves , an average of , i think it was 2.66 years ,
because although we all think we can catch a liar from their body language and speech patterns ,
and like many of these design exercises , it kind of seems trivial at first , but under deep inspection , it turns out that it reveals unexpected truths about the way that we collaborate and make sense of things .
so nodes represent the tangible objects like the toaster and people , and links represent the connections between the nodes .
and systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model .
and the practice is really pretty simple .
i &apos;m an artist and i cut books .
and with the material itself , i &apos;m using sandpaper
and it &apos;s very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future .
and i think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans .
and the result , as so often in science , was boring :

a beautiful month-old baby who was admitted with signs of a severe respiratory infection .
what do i mean by that ? is there any other effect beyond protecting ourselves ?
all these people depend almost exclusively on herd immunity to be protected against diseases .
it was fraudulent .
at that time , we set out to understand what was happening .

and now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers .
all the basic sciences support them , including math .
and the world , as you know , split into pappists and anti-pappists , until 1700 years later when in 1999 , thomas hales proved that pappus and the bees were right -- the best shape to use was the hexagon .
but if you want to tell them that you &apos;ll love them forever and ever , give them a theorem !
well , nothing .
i knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the saddest and longest nights of my life .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so important that we prioritize our psychological health , that we practice emotional hygiene .
and his eyes opened wide and he said , &quot; where have i seen your face before ? &quot; and i said , &quot; in the front seat . &quot;
and it &apos;s interesting that we do , because our self-esteem is already hurting .
but i knew what to do .

she didn &apos;t give me a response , and what she said was this : she said , &quot; why don &apos;t you leave your number , and if we have some openings , i &apos;ll give you a call ? &quot;
so , what i did -- and he said , &quot; you shouldn &apos;t worry , jim , because there are a lot of trailer parks . &quot;
and we saw one , it was a great big , bright flashing light that said , &quot; vacancies , vacancies , vacanies . &quot; so we stopped in .
i jumped on a plane and shot off to goose bay , labrador , which is another story , right ?
you need to ask them for their identification . &apos; &quot; and here &apos;s what the boys have been taught to tell them : &quot; we know that you can do that , but please do not do that while we &apos;re in the car because the consequences for you are significantly different than the consequences for us . &quot;
these are the statistics of our infrastructure .

or , &quot; i can &apos;t find good talent ; my team is so below expectations . &quot;
and your journey is simple -- it &apos;s made of steps .
well , it turns out that we do have something just like that : our gut , or rather , its microbes .
and so when we do that with the human microbiome data from 250 healthy volunteers , it looks like this .
so whichever way we look at it , we &apos;re vastly outnumbered by our microbial symbionts .
now , for the first time , you &apos;re going to see one of my colleague &apos;s children develop microbially .
they may also be degrading our gut microbial ecosystems ,
this is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pilot therapies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different mice with individual people &apos;s gut communities
so one day after you do that transplant , all those symptoms clear up , the diarrhea vanishes , and they &apos;re essentially healthy again , coming to resemble the donor &apos;s community , and they stay there .
they tend to consolidate in the hands of the few , and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many .
how do they stay competitive ?
in the summer of 2011 , as a tourist , i visited the rainforests of borneo for the very first time ,
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of nowhere .
but in fact , cell phones are great .
that guy &apos;s much braver than i am .
twenty-five years ago , scientists at cern created the world wide web .
before the invention of email , we largely communicated using letters ,
and to optimize the ads that are shown to us , companies have to know everything about us .
well , it &apos;s probably a good idea not to put the keys on the server .
and i think the answer is actually yes ,
this really matters , because ultimately , privacy depends on each and every one of us , and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zeros .
ninety percent of everything is crap , so there &apos;s this to prove that sturgeon was correct .

it served to recontextualize my experiences , and i then began to look at the world of humiliation and bullying around me and see something different .
the documents which received the most attention were private emails that had maximum public embarrassment value .

you can read between the lines in those questions , and the answer has nothing to do with politics .
our society is more technologically advanced than ever .
it &apos;s part of the general field of artificial intelligence .
so by age three , a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world .
now that we have the data to nourish our computer brain , we &apos;re ready to come back to the algorithms themselves .

theaster gates : how to revive a neighborhood : with imagination , beauty and art
it is not a gated community by far .
so we were not only thinking about development , but we were thinking about the program , thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another , between one neighbor and another .
and so now that the rumor of my block has spread , and lots of people are starting to visit , we &apos;ve found that the bank can now be a center for exhibition , archives , music performance , and that there are people who are now interested in being adjacent to those buildings because we brought some heat , that we kind of made a fire .
theaster gates : one of the things i &apos;ve found that &apos;s really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project , like an old house , but what &apos;s the relationship between an old house , a local school , a small bodega , and is there some kind of synergy between those things ?
so how do you start to grow up important watchdogs that ensure that the resources that are made available to new folk that are coming in are also distributed to folk who have lived in a place for a long time .
in my childhood , they taught me silence .
i saw the killings . i saw the displacement .

that &apos;s the easy part , the technology .
and maybe in doing so , we &apos;ll learn to listen a little more and shout a little less .
but i &apos;ve done more in the seven decades since that miserable day when my mother put me on the train than i would ever have dreamed possible .
so i had to compromise with operational research work , which had the intellectual challenge that interested me and the commercial value that was valued by the clients : things like scheduling freight trains , time-tabling buses , stock control , lots and lots of stock control .
if success were easy , we &apos;d all be millionaires .
and that made me able to cope with change , indeed , eventually to welcome change , though i &apos;m told i &apos;m still very difficult .

but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable .
shhhhhhhhhhh . you do not know the power of the dark side .

so if china does become the world &apos;s largest economy , think about this : it &apos;ll be the first time since this guy was on the throne of england -- george iii , not a good friend of napoleon &apos;s -- that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non-english speaking country , a non-western country , a non-liberal democratic country .
and she said , &quot; understand this , learn this , because it &apos;s going to affect your future . &quot;
history is against us when it comes to the u.s. and china forging a common future together .
number one : china feels as if it &apos;s been humiliated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history ,
the challenge , though , is given those deep-rooted feelings , those deep-rooted emotions and thought patterns , what the chinese call &quot; sīwéi , &quot; ways of thinking , how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two ?
and they walked into this cafe quietly , tentatively , gingerly , a little anxious .
you can make a practical contribution ,
i wanted the rocket .
and this was great , and i saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that i had made in rectangles .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is not a view into the world , it &apos;s basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle .
and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people .
the problem is that we have these color-tinted glasses as we look at all kinds of situations .
imagine i took all the people in the u.s. and i sorted them from the poorest on the right to the richest on the left , and then i divided them into five buckets : the poorest 20 percent , the next 20 percent , the next , the next , and the richest 20 percent .
he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it , you would be willing to enter it in a random place .

how do we get people to think differently about inequality and the consequences of inequality in terms of health , education , jealousy , crime rate , and so on ?
my parents also fled to pakistan , and settled in quetta , where i was born .

shabbir and nawroz were never seen again .

when you put many children in a quiet box , some of them get really nervous .
this is how they divide classrooms .

these are the people -- forget about allowing them to go to the temples , they cannot even go into the houses and shops of high-caste people .
i went to another leader and his wife told me , &quot; okay , you go , he will definitely join . &quot;
and after that , i should organize a feast for priests , 101 priests , wash their feet and drink that water .
i thought that if i keep on freeing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that &apos;s not done .
anger is within each one of you ,
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve traded a lot of crazy manias .
yes , that &apos;s us , with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems , according to those metrics .
we &apos;re but messengers , but we have 100 percent confidence and faith in the american public to get it right .
well , you know , sometimes
beyond this horizon we don &apos;t know where we are coming from .
well , actually , it is .
everything you see in this picture is a living organism .
celestial mechanics is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets ,
they were screaming with laughter .
so what i &apos;m doing now is you see something much more like this .
you can catch laughter from somebody else , and you are more likely to catch laughter off somebody else if you know them .
chimpanzees laugh differently if they &apos;re being tickled than if they &apos;re playing with each other ,
and i think what that means is , even if you &apos;re having your brain scanned , which is completely boring and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , &quot; a ha ha ha ha ha , &quot; you &apos;re trying to work out why they &apos;re laughing .
there &apos;s a really lovely set of studies coming out from robert levenson &apos;s lab in california , where he &apos;s doing a longitudinal study with couples .
and now they &apos;re all off .
&lt; speaker &gt; jedidah isler &lt; / speaker &gt;
clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until 2008 , when nasa launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light -- that is , light with energies a million times higher than your standard x-ray scan .
unfortunately , all his spinosaurus bones were destroyed in world war ii .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it &apos;s useful for buoyancy control in the water .
the things i had to see , and feel and touch were pretty unspeakable . what i can tell you is this : that the rwandan genocide was one of the world &apos;s greatest failures of simple compassion .
thirty-five years ago , when i would have been graduating from high school , they told us that 40,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
those two forms of violence account for more death and disability than malaria , than car accidents , than war combined .
listen . dispatcher : i don &apos;t have anybody to send out there .
so you would think that the disintegration of basic law enforcement in the developing world would be a huge priority for the global fight against poverty .
violence can be stopped .
there &apos;s a political will struggle that &apos;s going to take place as well , but those are winnable fights , because we &apos;ve done some examples around the world at international justice mission that are very encouraging .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : as kids , we all get advice from parents and teachers that seems strange , even confusing . this was crystallized one night for a young clint smith , who was playing with water guns in a dark parking lot with his white friends . in a heartfelt piece , the poet paints the scene of his father &apos;s furious and fearful response .

a biological neuron fires , maybe , at 200 hertz , 200 times a second .
all of this superintelligence could develop , and possibly quite rapidly .

today i want to talk about the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the united states .
young people worried that at any moment , they will be stopped , searched and seized .
sometimes children would simply give up running ,
that winter , a kid in the schoolyard called chuck &apos;s mom a crack whore .
and then a juvenile judge , a few days later , charged tim , age 11 , and then he was placed on three years of probation .
we tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way : good and bad , innocent and guilty .
texas has gotten into the game now , also closing prisons , investing in education .
her plan was to row it alone across the atlantic ocean --
tmm : do you guys have a weather report , over ?

but now i &apos;m so heavy , nothing consoles me .
until last year , i &apos;d never kept bees before , but national geographic asked me to photograph a story about them ,
in the long run , that &apos;s bad news ,
thank you .
will i see my family or die alone ?
incarcerated 29 years .
this is not my home .
the living room overlooks the valley from the fourth floor .
try getting that truck down the mountain .
it looks a lot like a kitchen , right ?
and what it says is : respect it , design for its strengths , protect it from water , and to make the most of its curves .
this floor is made of glossy and durable bamboo skin .
it is beautiful , gold standard . love it .
the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory .
whet moser : like , there &apos;s probably at least one store on every block near where i work that sells some sort of chicago flag paraphernalia .
tk : it &apos;s a relatively complex flag .
but sometimes it isn &apos;t , all right ?
and because it &apos;s so badass , those flags and crosses are found throughout amsterdam ,
sk : i believe milwaukee is a great city . every great city deserves a great flag .
this one &apos;s by neil mussett .
but a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people to the world at large .
they &apos;re legal things .
in 2000 , the indian supreme court held that the holy books of the sikh religion was a legal person , and in 2012 , just recently , there was a treaty between the indigenous peoples of new zealand and the crown , in which it was agreed that a river was a legal person who owned its own riverbed .
now , the common law is the kind of law that english-speaking judges can make when they &apos;re not cabined in by statutes or constitutions , and a writ of habeus corpus is called the great writ , capital g , capital w ,
then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be .
and they excavated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these rocks , had passed down for at least 4,300 years through 225 chimpanzee generations .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : &quot; anything that is worth pursuing is going to require us to suffer , just a little bit , &quot; says surf photographer chris burkard , as he explains his obsession with the coldest , choppiest , most isolated beaches on earth . with jawdropping photos and stories of places few humans have ever seen -- much less surfed -- he draws us into his &quot; personal crusade against the mundane . &quot;
i set out seeking adventure , and what i was finding was only routine .
they walked off with our food and bits of our tent , clearly letting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot , not ours .
see , i gave a piece of myself in these places , and what i walked away with was a sense of fulfillment i had always been searching for .
every citizen wears the badge of the great leader at all times .
even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass .
during those months of living in their world , i often wondered if the truth would , in fact , improve their lives .
i don &apos;t want to imagine what might happen to you .
the person i believed for half of my life to have superpowers suddenly needed help to get dressed or to cut food .
designed to strengthen muscles and improve balance .
tr : so right now , you &apos;re doing clinical trials in clinics .
she said she saw an aura of energy around me .
my youngest daughter did an absolutely brilliant five-year-old thing .
and that &apos;s exactly how we felt about jenesis .
and they gave me , like , a little plastic ziploc bag of a small amount of powder .
mr : exactly , chris . there &apos;s some 3,000 people a year in the united states alone , perhaps 10 times that number worldwide , who continue to die of this illness
and all of this information stored there will be able , in the next couple decades , once software is able to recapitulate consciousness , be able to revive the consciousness which is imminent in our mind file .
and for me personally and bina personally , we love each other like crazy .
we either saw the launches from our backyard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the cape .
came back to earth at speeds of up to 822 miles an hour .
it will actually heat water that will wrap around my body .
this is dave clearing the airspace with the faa for 15 miles .
and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get , 822 miles an hour .
but watch what happens when i pull it out .
it &apos;s just very , very hard . &quot;
who is out there ?
we know their size , and their orbit and things like that .
it &apos;s somewhat warm .
and this is really a field of its own .
so , we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field .
so after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there , and we build the very complicated space telescopes that might be out there , what are we going to find ?
so i am really struck by the notion in your career of the opposition you faced , that when you began thinking about exoplanets ,
would it surprise you ?
let me give you an example .
actually , in places like malaysia , muslim women on rigs isn &apos;t even comment-worthy . there are that many of them .
there &apos;s a lack of opportunity , and that &apos;s due to unconscious bias .
a mentor who said to me , &quot; hey , your story &apos;s interesting .

an informant can earn 100,000 dollars or more for every terrorism case they bring to the fbi .

tr : so the intercept is that new investigative journalism website , that &apos;s cofounded by glenn greenwald .
now , i &apos;ve been making pictures for quite a long time , and normally speaking , a picture like this , for me , should be straightforward .
it was about a boyfriend . the girl on the top , she &apos;d kissed the wrong boy , and they &apos;d started having a fight .
the whole world came running ,
i sort of looked at myself standing there , going , &quot; oh , jimmy , this is complete loads of codswallop .
now , the huli are some of the most extraordinarily beautiful people on the planet .
we spend the whole of our existence revolving around beauty : beautiful places , beautiful things , and ultimately , beautiful people .
the children need to chew the meat all day because the adults don &apos;t have any teeth ,
first we destroy , yeah ? then we reflect .
now you have no excuse . it &apos;s almost lunchtime , and this is not a standing ovation , so don &apos;t worry ,
twain meant it as a joke , of course , but he &apos;s right :
and because you &apos;re going to see just two movies , you &apos;re going to see just two babies ,
and we can ensure it &apos;s exactly the same because we have a secret compartment and we actually pull the balls from there ,
take this baby , for instance .
this time , hyowon is going to succeed once and fail once , and so am i .
and indeed , there have been staggering discoveries in neuroscience : localizing functionally specialized regions of cortex , turning mouse brains transparent , activating neurons with light .

and that &apos;s why i came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
timing accounted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
just two years later , when the codec problem was solved by adobe flash and when broadband penetration crossed 50 percent in america , youtube was perfectly timed .
as john sits on dan &apos;s bed , a train goes rushing by , rattling everything in the room .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
if it stops us from noticing the problems that are around us , well , that &apos;s bad .
not the way we think it is .
what did we do instead ?
people understood them .
if you take a step back and look at all the boxes , maybe there &apos;s a way to remove one or combine them so that you can make that process much simpler .
so if we focus on those tiny details , the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say , &quot; are those important or is that the way we &apos;ve always done it ?
our challenge is to wake up each day and say , &quot; how can i experience the world better ? &quot;
i remember her being beaten and slapped by another member of my family .
that story lets us off the hook .
once everyone arrived in new jersey , the young girls were taken away , and put to work for 14-hour days , seven days a week , for five years .
trafficking doesn &apos;t happen in a vacuum .
i found multiple layers of plausible deniability between grower and distributor and processor , and god knows who else .
these people were the most resourceful and resilient and responsible in their communities .
so let us tell it the way we should have done , from the very beginning . let us tell this story together .
it was labeled &quot; low-performing and persistently dangerous &quot; due to its low test scores and high number of weapons , drugs , assaults and arrests .
i am the principal , and having that title required me to lead .
they said that only 68 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis , 100 percent of them live in poverty ,
but because of my amazing mother , i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surrounded me .
what are we going to do about it ? &quot;
it was quite binary at that time .
there you are in my ear .
well , it &apos;s not like what you have with the internet .
right , so next subject is a young woman -- -- next subject , class , is a young woman called bella , a university student interviewed in 2016 during what was called an intro to feminist porn class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but you got to get into the spirit of it if you &apos;re going to interview me .
she said , maureen fitzroy is the living embodiment of the whore-virgin dichotomy .
you know , i never was a wife or a nun , or a prostitute even , really , not really .
and , in fact , most people would have been aware of issues like human trafficking , for example , but they would have seen that as quite separate from more recreational adult entertainment .
my brothers who i &apos;m close to , those guys , they &apos;re all like me .
so i &apos;m on a mission to change that .
teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard , because these action units , they can be fast , they &apos;re subtle , and they combine in many different ways .
and then eyebrow raised , indicator of surprise .
not only do they smile more , their smiles last longer , and we can now really quantify what it is that men and women respond to differently .

polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions are completely opposite from each other ; a diametrical opposition .

chickens live in groups , so first of all , he selected just an average flock , and he let it alone for six generations .
instead , they had three characteristics , the really successful teams .
but there isn &apos;t a single high-tech company i &apos;ve worked with that imagines for a moment that this is a technology issue , because what drives helpfulness is people getting to know each other .
when alex pentland suggested to one company that they synchronize coffee breaks so that people would have time to talk to each other , profits went up 15 million dollars , and employee satisfaction went up 10 percent .
now , we need to let people motivate each other .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : for the longest time , doctors basically ignored the most basic and frustrating part of being sick -- pain . in this lyrical , informative talk , latif nasser tells the extraordinary story of wrestler and doctor john j. bonica , who persuaded the medical profession to take pain seriously -- and transformed the lives of millions .
something had gone wrong with the lion tamer .
he still wrestled in secret -- he had to .
he was only 27 .
but the most important thing about his book was that it was kind of an emotional alarm bell for medicine .
but still , i love imagining it .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : in 2011 , the us armed forces still had a ban on women in combat -- but in that year , a special operations team of women was sent to afghanistan to serve on the front lines , to build rapport with locals and try to help bring an end to the war . reporter gayle tzemach lemmon tells the story of this &quot; band of sisters , &quot; an extraordinary group of women warriors who helped break a long-standing barrier to serve .

and then , there are those of us who don &apos;t have the privilege of sitting in traffic .
we just reduced accidents on our roads by a factor of two .
it starts by understanding where it is in the world , by taking a map and its sensor data and aligning the two ,
now , the way we accomplish this is by sharing data between the vehicles .
and you might notice in the bottom , we can &apos;t actually see the cyclist yet , but the car can : it &apos;s that little blue box up there ,
at some point , and then a driver is going to say , &quot; this feels safe , &quot; and climb into the back , and something ugly will happen .
i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dreaming of my goal .
five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were thrust underwater , and that five seconds goes quickly .
you could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation , even as a passenger .
and having two choices : i either put that stone to one side and learn more about it , or i put that stone back and i carry on with my dream job of sailing around the world .
with more people in the world with more stuff , we &apos;ve effectively seen 100 years of price declines in those basic commodities erased in just 10 years .
it &apos;s an economy that fundamentally can &apos;t run in the long term ,
what if we could turn that into fertilizer , heat , energy , ultimately reconnecting nutrients systems and rebuilding natural capital ?
when he was born , there were only 25 cars in the world ; they had only just been invented .
so our overall commitment at the carter center is to promote human rights , and knowing the world as i do , i can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse of human rights on earth is , strangely , not addressed quite often , is the abuse of women and girls .
nebraska this week just passed a law abolishing the death penalty , because it costs so much . so the resort to violence and abuse of poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase in abuse of women .
and the average brothel owner in atlanta and in the united states now can earn about $ 35,000 per slave .
when i became president , the difference was 39 percent .
the average woman in egypt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth .
but there are things that , for example , basketball coaches want to know .
or i could be wrong , they could all be pick-and-rolls .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very messy .
we can look at all their velocities and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot would go in under these circumstances ?
and our ability to know the shot probability for every player at every second , and the likelihood of them getting a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way that we never could before .
okay , i will ! it was four .
my uncle , my aunt , my brother or sister , cannot force me to marry .
there is this special day , which they call &quot; very special day &quot; where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls .
but every day after refusing , women would tell me , &quot; look at you , you &apos;re all grown up . your little sister has a baby .
so we did that . it was a good thing .
manuel lima : a visual history of human knowledge
the more we know about the brain , the more we think of it as a large music symphony , played by hundreds and thousands of instruments .
and what they did here is , they actually segmented the network into three different years , represented by the vertical layers that you see behind me .
at the top left , the very first project is a gene network , followed by a network of ip addresses -- machines , servers -- followed by a network of facebook friends .
as you actually navigate that space and bounce along those elastic ropes , the entire network kind of shifts , almost like a real organic network would .
before polly , no one had ever told me that she &apos;d had an abortion .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
i wish i could tell you that when you decide to be pro-voice , that you &apos;ll find beautiful moments of breakthrough and gardens full of flowers , where listening and storytelling creates wonderful &quot; a-ha &quot; moments .
so , she decided to get comfortable .
so , last year i was pregnant again .
as a young muslim woman , i am very proud of my faith .
it teaches you the importance of messaging .
why were women being relegated to positions which predated the teachings of our faith ?
so initially , i focused on the economic and political empowerment of women .
but we have to be at the table .
and i didn &apos;t realize i would end up going over 30,000 miles at the start , but i ended up going and meeting loads of different people , from a transgender crack dealer in brownsville , brooklyn , to a scientist who spends a lot of time feeding hallucinogens to mongooses to see if they like them -- it turns out they do , but only in very specific circumstances -- to the only country that &apos;s ever decriminalized all drugs ,
if you do that , the rat will almost always prefer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly .
what if addiction is about your cage ?
one percent of the population was addicted to heroin , which is kind of mind-blowing ,
if you have a crisis in your life , you &apos;ll notice something .
so i was thinking , how could i be portuguese ?
i &apos;ve always been obsessed with how couples meet .
he said , &quot; you &apos;re in an elevator running late for a meeting .
our contact there was george , who runs the community &apos;s photography club .
george was actually an alcoholic when they married , and mary knew it .
now , i am not one of those people .
now , i will maintain. and i think i can defend , what may seem like a surprising statement .
so for example , take katydids ,
and part of the confusion was that they were aware of the stinging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bore such a weapon could possibly be a female .
the way things are supposed to be .
voiceless people realized that they had a voice , and it was powerful and eloquent .
imagine if this was an actual court , and the accused was in the dark , begging for another chance , and the jury was yelling out , &quot; bored ! sociopath ! &quot;
i am beyond horrified . &#93; was anybody on twitter that night ? a few of you .
and that person got a free pass .
and if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you &apos;ve just been torn to shreds because of a misconstrued liberal joke , not by trolls , but by nice people like us ,
justine had 170 twitter followers , and so to make it work , she had to be fictionalized .
so i think that &apos;s the way forward ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : when artist salvatore iaconesi was diagnosed with brain cancer , he refused to be a passive patient -- which , he points out , means &quot; one who waits . &quot; so he hacked his brain scans , posted them online , and invited a global community to pitch in on a &quot; cure . &quot; this sometimes meant medical advice , and it sometimes meant art , music , emotional support -- from more than half a million people .
and , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenarios ,
the la cura website went viral .
which was very intense ,
for the minaret , i thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mosque should come from the quran ,
in south africa , in cape town , the local community of philippi offered me the only concrete wall of the slum .
that was made in 1937 by the general drafting company .
and the world would be a different place if we projected europe to show it in its actual size .
and i became a learner , because i found myself
it wasn &apos;t a formal , organized learning process , and i &apos;m happy to admit that .

vi hart and &quot; minute physics &quot; introduced me to all kinds of things that i didn &apos;t know before .
monuments to war , such as maya lin &apos;s vietnam memorial , are often enormous in scale .
the way he says &quot; thank you &quot; really creeps me out .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : seventy thousand years ago , our human ancestors were insignificant animals , just minding their own business in a corner of africa with all the other animals . but now , few would disagree that humans dominate planet earth ; we &apos;ve spread to every continent , and our actions determine the fate of other animals . how did we get from there to here ? historian yuval noah harari suggests a surprising reason for the rise of humanity .
are you a nice chimpanzee ?
prisons are a system of cooperation ;
but what i want to emphasize is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms of mass-scale human cooperation , not only in the religious field .
mostly , they try to make money .
all other animals live in an objective reality .
bg : ok , so you &apos;re basically saying in the book and now , that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality , we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ?
in the 1850s , brigham young dispatched families to st. george to grow cotton because of the hot , arid climate .

and so right now , you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets ,
if we think about the scale of size , start with an everyday object like the tennis ball , and just go down orders of magnitude in size -- from the eye of a needle down to a cell , down to a bacterium , down to an enzyme -- you eventually reach the nano-world .
so does all inanimate matter , made up of trillions of atoms .
well , one man begged to differ with this idea . erwin schrödinger , of schrödinger &apos;s cat fame , was an austrian physicist .
in fact , it &apos;s the reason our sun shines .
the question is : how likely are they to do that , and if they do , how do they do it ?
to give it directional information -- a built-in compass .
sounds familiar ?
why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now ?
and make no mistake about it -- it &apos;s not a question of &quot; if , &quot; but &quot; when . &quot;
being able to see damage from angles you can &apos;t get from binoculars on the ground or from a satellite image , or anything flying at a higher angle .
that was a huge problem at the haiti earthquake .
it &apos;s not making more sensors .
we can shorten it that way .
and our ancestors , for as long as there &apos;s been recorded history , have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence .
the scale is comparable in height ; in fact , it &apos;s smaller than this telescope will be .
and each of those galaxies may contain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars .
and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds .

not that i &apos;m suggesting anyone in this audience would use it to go and procure high-quality narcotics .
i do hope we can do business together .
but then they realized there was a problem with bitcoin , because every bitcoin transaction is actually recorded publicly in a public ledger .
we &apos;re worried about who might be watching us .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i &apos;m not talking about the technology of things , profound though that is .
so the work example is merely an example of how false ideas can create a circumstance that ends up making them true .
i would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by letting you know that i know something about fear and anxiety .
we suspended our values .
and so the parts of the u.s. government that do foresight , that look forward , that do strategy -- the parts in other governments that do this -- can &apos;t do it , because they &apos;re reacting to the news cycle .
and we know this because we &apos;ve been in it for several years .
we &apos;re now seeing that our basic assumptions about the internet -- that it was going to connect us , weave society together -- are not necessarily true .
and that gets us to another breakdown that &apos;s crucial , and another breakdown that couldn &apos;t be more important to a group like this ,
these are fundamental issues . where are the philosophers ?

i &apos;ve been talking to the boomers , who are their bosses , and i go , &quot; what do you think about the millennials ? &quot;
and you heard president carter talk about how title ix is protected .
and every one of you is an influencer .
they met when they all had small children , through a parenting class at a family resource center in san francisco .
and her mother was heartbroken over what was happening .
it &apos;s a home for poets , musicians and artists .
i &apos;ve built a career .
what if we recognized that what &apos;s working is the people and what &apos;s broken is our approach ?
let &apos;s use some of our substantial collective power toward inventing and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us .
so we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that .
i &apos;m kind of the generic person .
this results in a syndrome that i like to call &apos; premature self-congratulation . &apos;
if you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives , gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live .
and they &apos;re in a terrible accident , and the father is killed ,
and i &apos;m going to propose something a little bit more radical , one word : &quot; share . &quot;
but i think it shows something important ,
i dedicated my presidency to having a space for those who felt marginalized on the island of ireland ,
it was later when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights .
in our very unequal world today , it &apos;s very striking how many people are left behind .
in hawaii , they &apos;re passing legislation to have 100 percent renewable energy by 2045 .
and indeed a few years later , the universal declaration of human rights .
i was marching with some of the elders family , and i saw a placard a little bit away from me , but we were wedged so closely together -- because after all , there were 400,000 people out in the streets of new york -- so i couldn &apos;t quite get to that placard , i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it , because it said , &quot; angry grannies ! &quot;
&lt; / doc &gt;
in my lifetime , countries had disappeared -- czechoslovakia ; appeared -- timor-leste ; failed -- somalia .
&quot; i &apos;m not a national , &quot; i proclaimed onstage . &quot; i &apos;m a local . i &apos;m multi-local . &quot;
we took off our shoes in the house , we were unfailingly polite with our elders , we ate slow-cooked , spicy food .
i have a friend named olu .
of course , when we ask , &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
here &apos;s one possibility : basically , countries represent power .
the more we know about where a story is set , the more local color and texture , the more human the characters start to feel ,
and why is storytelling important ?
when our ancestors first came here , they warned , &quot; stay out of these areas , they &apos;re haunted .
and this is a natural process that &apos;s occurred for thousands of years and we &apos;re just now learning about it .
for better or for worse , the story of the everglades is intrinsically tied to the peaks and the valleys of mankind &apos;s relationship with the natural world .
so i built this submerged platform that would hold snails just right under the water . and i spent months planning this crazy idea .
it won &apos;t happen because they &apos;re so ubiquitous , we see them now , they &apos;re one of the great conservation success stories of the us .
we &apos;re slowly undertaking these projects to bring more freshwater back to the bay .
if we pass it , we get to keep the planet .
i feel distilled by it , and i actually very much like the woman i &apos;m distilling into .
skip over all the pages reassuring religious people .
stare as long as you need to .
to have come to this place , lived to this moment : immeasurable lightness .
you can imagine as a child what i went through .
i had a good life .
it helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
thank you .
and you know , i just looked at them , and i said , &quot; what school ? where is the school ? &quot;
i was very happy . i was delighted with the outcome of my work .
you train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s not you . what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
so we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
&lt; / doc &gt;
it could even cause some deaths .
and our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range .
we also know that we have to decarbonize our energy system .
and this applies to all of us , whatever sphere of influence we have .
there &apos;s still some confusion about that question , as this is a fairly new field of research .
so in an animal model of depression , we have seen that we have a lower level of neurogenesis .
i will let you judge that one by yourself .
and on your side -- i leave you in charge of your neurogenesis .
now , the reason for the dominance of this model is of course the antibiotic revolution .
and we begin with a self-regulating , semi-autonomous unit called a cell .
and we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the physiology of the organ , the brain , rewire it , remodel it ,
nothing happened .
they &apos;re also , number three , the most efficient repairers of fractures that we &apos;ve ever encountered .
could that stop some of the degeneration ?
thank you .
michael green : how we can make the world a better place by 2030
well , a lot of it was because of economic growth .
so there &apos;s our target , 75 out of 100 .
now this seems a bit strange .
and that &apos;s really important , because it tells us two things .
and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that , called the people &apos;s report card .
then we can really see , how are we doing ?
but then , after a month , the police in norway got a message from the police in the netherlands .
but it is also a story about what it &apos;s like to be a refugee in europe today .
and we did dna samples of him , and later on got additional dna samples from mouaz &apos;s closest relative who now lives in jordan .
and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m in calais . i need you to come get my backpack and my laptop .
they had a difficult time , but they were positive , they had hope .
is there any strip lighting in your happy place ?
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
most of all , we wanted to create an intimate , beautiful thing that could live in your pocket and be loved .
we are the people that actually build our world , there are no artificial intelligences ...
karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents &apos; surface , and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world , which is a big number .
so how can it be possible ?
and the caves represent , really , a snapshot of the past .
and we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems , and each one with its own undiscovered world .
bg : francesco , grazie . fs : grazie .
we couldn &apos;t believe this was happening .
thirty percent of our text messages are about suicide and depression -- huge .
we had a spike in volume also .
i &apos;m inspired -- i want to use tech and data to make the world a better place .
and ella says to me that she is repeating the cycle of her own mother &apos;s life before her .
when did you go to school ? &quot;
and in a really short space of time , something new started to grow : a relationship between the team and the workers .
but at the same time , beveridge sowed the seeds of today &apos;s challenges .
and damon , who runs the local circle , calls her back and says , &quot; how can i help ? &quot;
but here , too , the systems are failing .
&lt; / doc &gt;
if people are spying on us , it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying .
we also organized guided tours to experience and sound out the power constellations on-site .
in the world of globalization , the continents are drifting closer to each other .
we have also established communication systems in remote refugee centers in switzerland and greece .
bg : and allow them to talk as well .
am i doing enough ?
they &apos;re nocturnal , solitary , very elusive animals , and we got started getting very basic data about these animals .
when the portuguese first arrived in brazil , beginning european colonization in the eastern part of south america .
the situation in the cerrado made me realize -- it gave me the sense of urgency .
these animals deserve to be cared for .
i wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to receive data from our li-fi lights .
so now this led lamp here is streaming a video by changing the brightness of the led in a very subtle way , and in a way that you can &apos;t recognize with your eye ,

there was a picture distributed widely over the internet where her face was distorted to look like a monkey .
and if there was somebody who immediately understood this ,
&quot; we like you , we dislike you .
we accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our secular lives ,
i had help raising my little daughter .
and what it caused me to do was defend myself and my people and everything we believe in , because we &apos;re not stupid .
in fact , my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation .
and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as 12 years old , escorted and walked past us as we all stood in line .
i found a different question to ask animals .
mostly boiled .
it turns out that if you record the voices of tourists and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes , elephants will ignore it , because tourists never bother elephants .
empathy is old , but empathy , like everything else in life , comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration .
but we see other animals and we say , &quot; oh look , killer whales , wolves , elephants :
in yellowstone national park , we killed every single wolf .
this whale is t20 .
when human beings use one thing to represent another , we call that art .
and every one of those animals in every painting of noah &apos;s ark , deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now , and their flood is us .
i mean -- me , it makes sense , right ?
over the last century , more than 350 ice age rock art sites have been found across the continent , decorated with animals , abstract shapes and even the occasional human like these engraved figures from grotta dell &apos;addaura in sicily .
some signs start out strong , before losing popularity and vanishing , while other signs are later inventions .
could some of the signs be weaponry or housing ?

when was it that you yourself realized that there might be impending peril for your country ?

ca : it must have been just an extraordinarily emotional day because of these questions about identity , the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emphasized sense of what they had lost .
we don &apos;t have a lot of livestock , so it &apos;s fish that we depend on .
ca : so there &apos;s so many things playing into this .
is it getting harder ? are the waters depleted ?
and it seems like it &apos;s very possible that your nation , despite , actually because of the intense problems you face , you may yet be the warning light to the world that shines most visibly , most powerfully .
at the very least , the scrapper deserves an interview .

it &apos;s often said that you can tell a lot about a person by looking at what &apos;s on their bookshelves .
french-speaking africa , on the other hand , will rarely ever get a look-in .
it turns out , if you want to read the world , if you want to encounter it with an open mind , the world will help you .
and i sent a copy out to each of my volunteers .
if we all read more widely , there &apos;d be more incentive for publishers to translate more books , and we would all be richer for that .
of course , my brothers were not happy about it ,
this led me to develop the home page reader in 1997 , first in japanese and later , translated into 11 languages .

statistically speaking , the shorter a woman &apos;s leave after having a baby , the more likely she will be to suffer from postpartum mood disorders like depression and anxiety ,

because what would happen if all of these individual so-called choices to have babies started to turn into individual choices not to have babies .
this is an american issue .
they provide food , income and food security for hundreds of millions of people around the world .

now , there are only a few hundred species of corals on the planet , maybe 1,000 .
and i tried those one by one by one , looking for the bacteria that would convince corals to settle and attach .
we have advanced medical technology , we have defense technology , we have scientific technology , we even have advanced technology for art .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : downloadable , printable clothing may be coming to a closet near you . what started as designer danit peleg &apos;s fashion school project turned into a collection of 3d-printed designs that have the strength and flexibility for everyday wear . &quot; fashion is a very physical thing , &quot; she says . &quot; i wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital . &quot;

but if you wanted to keep growing cattle in a time and place where water resources are limited , you &apos;re growing seaweed in the water , you don &apos;t have to water it -- major consideration .
i first actually got into this topic when i heard about the ebola outbreak last year .
the first thing i thought was , &quot; this is no good . &quot;
and two years ago , even , this project would not have happened , just because the technology then wouldn &apos;t have supported it .

cancun is famous for spring break , tequila and foam parties .
general relativity is unquestionably einstein &apos;s masterpiece , a theory which reveals the workings of the universe at the grandest scales ,
well , that is kind of true , but the higgs boson is particularly special .
now , according to early versions of the big bang theory , the universe has been expanding ever since with gravity gradually putting the brakes on that expansion .
it turns out that string theory isn &apos;t one theory at all , but a whole collection of theories .
my experiment published paper after paper where we glumly had to conclude that we saw no signs of new physics .
so it &apos;s only a good thing .
the world food programme was forced , for lack of resources , to cut by 30 percent food support to the syrian refugees .
i &apos;ll try to ask them , make them blunt .
bg : but there are villages in germany with 300 inhabitants and 1,000 refugees .
bg : we &apos;ll come back to that too , but you mentioned the cutting of funding and the vouchers from the world food programme .
because you are talking about children in school , you are talking about health , you are talking about infrastructure that is overcrowded .
because they see refugees as people that should be with the caliphate and are fleeing to the crusaders .
there are no clear power relations in the world , no global governance mechanisms that work ,
most of what we know about human life we know from asking people to remember the past ,
some developed alcoholism . a few developed schizophrenia .
so the second big lesson that we learned is that it &apos;s not just the number of friends you have , and it &apos;s not whether or not you &apos;re in a committed relationship , but it &apos;s the quality of your close relationships that matters .
the people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : we &apos;ve invested so much in police departments as protectors that we have forgotten what it means to serve our communities , says baltimore police officer lt. colonel melvin russell . it &apos;s led to coldness and callousness , and it &apos;s dehumanized the police force . after taking over as district commander in one of baltimore &apos;s toughest neighborhoods , russell instituted a series of reforms aimed at winning back the trust of the community and lowering the violent crime rate . &quot; law enforcement is in a crisis , &quot; he says . &quot; but it &apos;s not too late for all of us to build our cities and nation to make it great again . &quot;
y &apos;all know what i &apos;m talking about .
and we shove them into the community and say , &quot; take that . &quot;
and so , as i try to hurry and get through this , i need to say this : it &apos;s not just law enforcement , though .
it &apos;s not somebody else &apos;s fault -- it &apos;s all of our fault .
i believe it should &apos;ve never happened if we were allowed to continue along the vein that we were in , servicing our community , treating them like human beings , treating them with respect , loving on them first .
but as it turns out , we know a lot more about space than we do about the underground waterways coursing through our planet , the very lifeblood of mother earth .

you might think that these plants look dead , but they &apos;re not .
most of them will either try to resist or avoid water loss .
the vegetative tissues , the roots and leaves of annuals , do not have much by way of inherent resistance , avoidance or tolerance characteristics .
do they all use the same mechanisms to be able to lose all that water and not die ?
but we &apos;re about to embark upon an extremely ambitious approach , in which we aim to turn on whole suites of genes that are already present in every crop .
so i ask the question , are they using the same genes ?
you &apos;re at the threshold of the sistine chapel .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : can we break bad habits by being more curious about them ? psychiatrist judson brewer studies the relationship between mindfulness and addiction -- from smoking to overeating to all those other things we do even though we know they &apos;re bad for us . learn more about the mechanism of habit development and discover a simple but profound tactic that might help you beat your next urge to smoke , snack or check a text while driving .
you can use this for more than just remembering where food is .
now , with mindfulness training , we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious .
but over time , as we learn to see more and more clearly the results of our actions , we let go of old habits and form new ones .
instead of see text message , compulsively text back , feel a little bit better -- notice the urge , get curious , feel the joy of letting go and repeat .

i was not a people person back then .

we do it because the same technology and the same approach , the machine learning of this code , is helping us to understand how we work , how your body works , how your body ages , how disease generates in your body , how your cancer grows and develops , how drugs work and if they work on your body .
so this is a talk about gene drives , but i &apos;m going to start by telling you a brief story .
i &apos;ll keep this quick , but mendelian genetics says when a male and a female mate , their baby inherits half of its dna from each parent .
so , what does this mean ? for one thing , it means we have a very powerful , but also somewhat alarming new tool .
but it &apos;s also true that if a dozen asian carp with the all-male gene drive accidentally got carried from the great lakes back to asia , they could potentially wipe out the native asian carp population .
in elephants or people , it would take centuries for a trait to spread widely enough to matter .
by that i mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
jim o &apos;grady : so i &apos;m banging out my story and i know it &apos;s good , and then i start to make it better -- by adding an element of embellishment .
and now listen to the click .
and if we are right , there &apos;s a strong prediction over here
so i know that if you are completely confused now , and i do hope that this is not the case , your brain responses are very different than mine .
so to test it in the lab , we did the following experiment .
and think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling to other people in your life .
of the 30 astronauts in the original mercury , gemini and apollo programs , only seven marriages survived .
i &apos;m talking about dreaming
what if we experimented with creating that kind of world these next few days ?
now when i say that , what most people hear me say is that we &apos;re working on curing cancer .
it sounds a little bit like science fiction .
we designed these nanoparticles to be activated by these enzymes .
but i think we all have to have dreams to keep us pushing forward , even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers .
but we only had three days to make it , and the only fabric we had was an old duvet cover that another resident left behind .
we were both artists downtown .
and she would draw her fingertip down over my face so slowly that i couldn &apos;t feel it moving .
another rule is that all mass is subject to entropy .
an answer worthy of my wife .
what we found was that flight simulators had been proven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real , in-flight training to train the pilots .
and what they found was a surprisingly high 76 percent increase in the learning effectiveness when using virtual laboratories over traditional teaching methods . but even more interestingly ,
and it really feels like it , you have to try this .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : are children poor liars ? do you think you can easily detect their lies ? developmental researcher kang lee studies what happens physiologically to children when they lie . they do it a lot , starting as young as two years old , and they &apos;re actually really good at it . lee explains why we should celebrate when kids start to lie and presents new lie-detection technology that could someday reveal our hidden emotions .
of course , we have hidden cameras in the room to watch their every move .
now , are children poor liars ?
so let &apos;s start with undergrads and law school students , who typically have limited experience with children .
we know that underneath our facial skin , there &apos;s a rich network of blood vessels .
and perhaps in the future , their risks for heart attack or hypertension .
each one &apos;s got three different motors , so now you can build things that move .
what happens is , these guys start multiplying and they fill up this entire scaffold .
and when we image them in the lab , you can see how the cellulose forms these structures .
one natural idea is that the deepest aspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine , to be conscious , to dream -- have always been the same .
one is just asking the experts , a bit like we do with dictionaries .
and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different , independent tradition .
so i picked up the phone , and i called polo , and in fact he was not feeling well .
you know , the security environment in somalia at that moment in time -- and nothing has really changed too much -- can best be described as &quot; mad max &quot; by way of &quot; a clockwork orange . &quot;
and so now the important part : can anything be done about this ?
now , we can have a circular argument here about whether this increase in fatalities is a response to the increase of small arms , or the other way around .
but know that how you give is just as important as how much you give .
each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece of our memories as time passes .
i got to the set and realized : it &apos;s a square .
now when i do these pictures , it &apos;s literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind .
and if you look closely in this picture , you can actually see time changing in those large television sets .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .
&lt; speaker &gt; cédric villani &lt; / speaker &gt;
and still , their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics .
but clever eratosthenes , using mathematics , was able to measure the earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent .
this algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness to determine automatically the most relevant web pages , in the same way as we used randomness in the galton board experiment .
let me evoke for you one of the most striking days in my mathematician &apos;s life .
it &apos;s just a complete battle between the problem and you .
they are a minority , but they overcompensate by being extra loud .
why comedy ?
fact : muslims invented justin timberlake .
so we walked into these banks in the cayman islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents .
in the fight against extreme poverty , i believe there are three powerful levers that we can lean on .
global poverty has powerful levers .
she is physically strong , mentally tough , and she will do whatever it takes to earn a better life for her children .
we don &apos;t need more genius types right now .
today , we have 2,000 of these rural field officers growing very quickly .
in fact , for the first time in human history , we have a vast amount of delivery infrastructure available to us .
until every girl like this one has an opportunity to earn her full human potential , we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race .
most people associate this type of action with gandhi and martin luther king .
at one point , the organizers delivered hundreds of eggs to various government buildings with a message : &quot; if you don &apos;t have the huevos &quot; -- the balls -- &quot; to stop corrupt candidates from running for office , you can borrow ours . &quot;
this is dangerous , because we now know that our old approaches of dealing with conflict are not adequate for the new challenges that we &apos;re facing .
i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
and the thing is that , again , knowing exactly how this works -- and i &apos;m a designer , i know exactly how the psychology of this works , i know exactly what &apos;s going on -- but it doesn &apos;t leave me with any choice , i still just get sucked into it .
nancy might want to disconnect , but then she &apos;d be worried : what if i &apos;m missing something important ?
he joked in our conversation that what if , instead of a spell check , you had a compassion check , meaning , you might highlight a word that might be accidentally abrasive -- perceived as abrasive by someone else .
can you imagine a whole world that worked this way ?
maybe you &apos;re not doing so well to start with , but let &apos;s start that conversation .
there are 1 million such schools in india .
but anyway , we jumped right in and as we jumped in , all sorts of ideas started flying at us .
has the toilet been made , has the meal been served .
he doesn &apos;t have the additional money , he doesn &apos;t have the resources .
i like to call it &quot; the chain of hope . &quot;
learning levels of children have stopped declining , and they have started going up .
but today , i &apos;m going to pick three i find interesting and share what actually it reminds me about launching new products and services .
or do they accept that this is the only truth ?
it reminds me that the world &apos;s in flux , and we have to respond to those changes .
the answer is rarely inside the building .
we named it amblyopsis hoosieri , the hoosier cavefish .
&lt; / doc &gt;
they compared dreyfus &apos;s handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that it was a match , even though outside professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity , but never mind that .
so this is why i call motivated reasoning , &quot; soldier mindset . &quot;
but it took him 10 years , and for part of that time , he himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army .
he said , &quot; if you want to build a ship , don &apos;t drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribute the work .
what they came up with was actually quite interesting .
so we began cultivating these products , these microbes , in our lab . we found that we can make essential amino acids from carbon dioxide using these microbes .
let me give you a specific example . in indonesia , an amount of virgin rainforest was cleared totaling the size of approximately ireland ,
that means we can make crops much faster than we &apos;re making them today .
hi . my name is marwa , and i &apos;m an architect .
and that reason is architecture .
over time , the united city has morphed into a city center with ghettos along its circumference .
in that sense , settlement , identity and social integration are all the producer and product of effective urbanism .
so that was an immense shock for me , and it was an immense shock for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political meltdown in my country .
those divisions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
this was a protest vote for many , a sense that nobody represented them , that they couldn &apos;t find a political party that spoke for them ,
how can we balance on the one hand addressing fear and alienation while on the other hand refusing vehemently to give in to xenophobia and nationalism ?
this illustration from the financial times post-brexit is really striking .
&lt; / doc &gt;
a few others and i today make these forests professionally -- anywhere and everywhere .
that would be the industrial way . it goes against nature .
when it &apos;s cold , frost formation happens only on the mulch , so soil can still breathe while it &apos;s freezing outside .
once established , these forests are going to regenerate themselves again and again -- probably forever .
and this is a term that some geologists are suggesting we should give to our current epoch , given how pervasive human influence has been over it .
and he said , &quot; the amazon . &quot;
and there &apos;s an interesting little paradox , too .
so this means that they &apos;re only available to the elites ,
so scientists have started calling ecosystems like these &quot; novel ecosystems , &quot; because they &apos;re often dominated by non-native species , and because they &apos;re just super weird .
which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is untouched is unloved .
the first time i entered manshiyat naser , it felt like a maze .
so for manshiyat naser , i decided to write in arabic the words of st. athanasius of alexandria , a coptic bishop from the third century , who said : , which means in english , &quot; anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly needs to wipe his eyes first . &quot; it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words .
they just work out of it .
the house of uncle bakheet and aunty fareeda was this kind of meeting point .
thank you .
so what we &apos;ve learned over the first century of neuroscience is that the brain is a very complicated network , made out of very specialized cells called neurons with very complex geometries ,
you can &apos;t look at these tiny connections .
because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain .
so one kind of biomolecule might get a blue color . another kind of biomolecule might get a red color .
it turns out that throughout biomedicine , there are other problems that expansion might help with .
