and i told it pretty much the same way i &apos;ve just shared it with you :
it &apos;s not negative ; it &apos;s positive . these are invest@@ ments that pay for themselves .
invest sustain@@ ably . maj@@ ora mentioned this .
i like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collap@@ se , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at brand@@ ing , i need your help on this .
so this is a picture of rural ha@@ iti . ha@@ iti is now 9@@ 8 percent de@@ forest@@ ed .
and conven@@ i@@ ently , one of my students was from ghana ,
and he &apos;s found that worldwide , you could prevent a million dea@@ ths swit@@ ching from wood to char@@ coal as a coo@@ king fuel . that &apos;s remarkable , but up until now , there weren &apos;t ways to do it without cu@@ tting down trees .
and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day .
ash@@ ra@@ f ghan@@ i : how to re@@ build a broken state
and that is that if we want to have one world , this one world cannot be based on huge po@@ ckets of exclu@@ sion , and then inclu@@ sion for some .
the least important form of capital , in this project , is financial capital -- money .
the world in which i oper@@ ate oper@@ ates with designs re@@ gar@@ ding roads , or dam@@ s , or provi@@ sion of electricity that have not been re@@ vis@@ ited in 60 years .
second is , when a country has been subjec@@ ted to one of the most im@@ men@@ se , bru@@ tal forms of exercise of power -- we had the red army for 10 continu@@ ous years , 1@@ 10,000 strong ,
you know , when i went back in december of 2001 , i had absolutely no desire to work with the af@@ gh@@ an government
a t-@@ shirt does .
but they do .
i &apos;m really trou@@ b@@ led by that . but anyway that &apos;s -- the basis of the thing that i want to share with you today , though , is that right back to where we in@@ sp@@ ire people who will be our great leaders later .
and , well , we didn &apos;t have drugs in those days . but i did competition model air@@ planes .
there were only three or four fli@@ ghts in 2003 .
for a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn &apos;t even know what it was for .
you remember the space race in the &apos; 6@@ 0s was for national pre@@ stige , because we lost the first two mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones .
and every dollar that flo@@ ws into that will be spent more effici@@ ently by a factor of 10 to 15 . and what that means is before we know it , the progress in human space flight , with no tax@@ pa@@ yer dollars , will be at a level of about five times as much as the current nasa bud@@ gets for human space flight .
what interests me in this speech is cars . autom@@ o@@ bi@@ les may be what you use , but cars are what we are , in many ways .
this sculp@@ ture is , of course , at the heart of all of it , and it &apos;s really what puts the cra@@ f@@ ts@@ man@@ ship into our cars .
you can understand that . it works in tru@@ is@@ ms .
that car sta@@ ys at the middle of all our relationships .
right ? and they decided that instead of , like , having a studio , and six or seven apart@@ ments , it was che@@ aper to r@@ ent eli@@ za@@ beth ta@@ yl@@ or &apos;s ex@@ -@@ house in m@@ ali@@ b@@ u .
so we went to ti@@ bu@@ ron , after three months ,
how could they take b@@ m@@ w &apos;s money , how could they have a ho@@ li@@ day for three months and produce nothing , nothing ?
we cut a lot of str@@ ings that didn &apos;t need to be there , and we for@@ ged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about .
we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours .
we fil@@ ter through some simple appar@@ at@@ uses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day fil@@ tering on top of a building in new york city .
and is getting very rap@@ id and very cheap .
this is a cartoon of the structure of ph@@ i x 17@@ 4 .
and here &apos;s that same dna automati@@ cally reas@@ se@@ mb@@ led 24 hours later .
let me just close with eth@@ ical and policy studies .
every week , it &apos;ll arri@@ ve at your door .
and the calls that -- you know how they say , &quot; your call may be recorded for quality as@@ sur@@ ance ? &quot;
and software companies make 35 percent of their re@@ venue from just these software up@@ gra@@ des .
it &apos;s not like the rest of the screen is so full of other compon@@ ents that you need to collap@@ se the choices .
i actually got to speak to pal@@ m when they were flying high in the &apos; 9@@ 0s , and after the talk , i met one of the employees .
you try rhy@@ ming with garage !
in my very last example --
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
sp@@ an than we do . that &apos;s pi@@ ti@@ ful , and it &apos;s preven@@ table .
and what was so amazing to me , and what f@@ its right in with what we &apos;re all talking about here at ted , is that there , right in the middle of this rain@@ forest , was some solar pan@@ els -- the first in that part of ecu@@ ad@@ or -- and that was main@@ ly to bring water up by pu@@ mp so that the women wouldn &apos;t have to go down .
and we use gs@@ i -- geo@@ graphic whatever it is , gs@@ i -- to deter@@ mine the range of the ch@@ im@@ ps .
the reason this was so exciting and such a break@@ through is at that time , it was thought that humans , and only humans , used and made tools .
we know that chimpan@@ ze@@ es and some other creatures can recognize themselves in mir@@ r@@ ors -- &quot; self &quot; as op@@ posed to &quot; other . &quot;
of course , but if you &apos;ve seen the cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ing poverty in some of these parts of the world it isn &apos;t a question of &quot; let &apos;s leave the tree for tomorrow . &quot; &quot; how am i going to feed my family today ?
somebody said that yesterday . and as i was traveling around , i kept meeting young people who &apos;d lost hope .
it &apos;s going to dep@@ end whether they &apos;re inner@@ -@@ city or rural .
violence leads to violence , at least in my view .
and thir@@ dly , the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last , talked about the in@@ dom@@ it@@ able human spirit .
thank you . it &apos;s really an honor and a privilege to be here spending my last day as a teen@@ a@@ ger .
i was a pas@@ sive obser@@ ver of the medical world .
and while i was doing this , i was reading the cancer liter@@ ature , trying to -- again -- famili@@ ari@@ ze myself with this new medical field .
it &apos;s the part of cancer that is the most dangerous .
16 percent ! meaning that there were these pin@@ point tumor@@ s in skelet@@ al muscle , but only .@@ 16 percent of actual meta@@ st@@ ases --
if those diseases where tis@@ su@@ es are deter@@ i@@ or@@ ating -- for example alzheimer &apos;s , where the brain , the brain cells , die and we need to re@@ store new brain cells , new func@@ tional brain cells -- what if we could , in the future , use cancer ? a tumor --
you can draw a little picture of that building , it can be used in ads --
and it was late in the even@@ ing . we &apos;d had a lot to drink .
it &apos;s taken several years to now look at it deta@@ ched and say --
i knew cra@@ ig and respec@@ ted him .
f@@ g : anyway , the si@@ za thing . it &apos;s a rich@@ er experience .
that was the real surprise of bil@@ ba@@ o .
f@@ g : ask mi@@ ri@@ am !
to come in and do the bil@@ ba@@ o effect .
r@@ sw : well , i &apos;m going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it &apos;s been very long .
chris has asked me to do a short performance , and so i &apos;m going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes -- to do that , and hopefully at the end have just a moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form .
what i and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were ma@@ dly in love , into a func@@ tional mri brain scanner .
you feel intense el@@ ation when things are going well ; m@@ ood s@@ wings into horri@@ ble desp@@ air when things are going poor@@ ly .
and , indeed , these people would say &quot; yes ! &quot; as if i had asked them to pass the sal@@ t .
the second of these three brain systems is roman@@ tic love : that el@@ ation , obse@@ ssion of early love .
then , women &apos;s worst invention was the p@@ low .
and i think that the television is like the global cam@@ p@@ fire .
&quot; well , men are more adul@@ ter@@ ous ! &quot;
not at any time on this planet have women been so educ@@ ated , so interesting , so capable .
they are se@@ ep@@ ing around the world .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know anything about person@@ ality . you know ?
so off they go and she &apos;s s@@ que@@ aling and s@@ que@@ e@@ zing him and laugh@@ ing and having a wonderful time .
and this gre@@ be , i think , sort of , mista@@ ked us for a pros@@ pe@@ ct ,
and they said , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
i think there &apos;s a lot more than 30 million -- well-@@ adap@@ ted solutions .
in other words : structure .
and so silicon , which we make right now -- it &apos;s part of our car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic problem in the manufac@@ ture of our chips --
color without pig@@ ments : this peac@@ o@@ ck is creating color with shape .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a sub@@ set of the elements in the perio@@ di@@ c table .
jan@@ ine ben@@ y@@ us : oh really ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
but i was interested in another definition of technology .
every single thing that we can think of -- and if you heard oli@@ via &apos;s talk about the sexual ha@@ bits , you &apos;ll realize that there isn &apos;t anything we can say that &apos;s true for all life ,
one of the things we see about life is that it moves from the inner to increasing soci@@ ability . and by that it means that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life .
this is ni@@ les el@@ dre@@ dge . he was the co-@@ develop@@ er with stephen j@@ ay g@@ ould of the theory of pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ated equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um .
even when we try to get rid of a technology , it &apos;s actually very hard .
and so a ha@@ mmer , when we gra@@ b a ha@@ mmer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re gra@@ bb@@ ing .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game exten@@ ds and continu@@ es even when you &apos;re gone .
we &apos;d like you to figure out how much asp@@ art@@ ame we should put in each can of diet pe@@ ps@@ i in order to have the perfect drink . &quot;
this was an enormous re@@ vel@@ ation .
and howard looked at their product line , and he said , what you have is a dead tom@@ a@@ to society .
in six var@@ ie@@ ties : che@@ ese , light , robu@@ st@@ o , rich &amp; amp ; he@@ ar@@ ty , old world traditional -- extra@@ -@@ ch@@ un@@ ky garden . that &apos;s howard &apos;s doing . that is howard &apos;s gift to the american people .
used to be , there were two mu@@ star@@ ds : french &apos;s and gul@@ den &apos;s .
for the l@@ onge@@ st time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
now in medical science , we don &apos;t want to know , necessarily , just how cancer works , we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer .
and --
during the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , you had m@@ sn@@ b@@ c po@@ sting about the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e on their blog , up@@ dat@@ ing it frequ@@ ently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blo@@ gging tools .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get cho@@ ked up , because this is my first p@@ et , and she passed away two years ago .
and you see this post .
i would spend hours looking at the connections , saying , &quot; oh , the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there . &quot;
i had to go for a one-@@ day trip .
&lt; speaker &gt; michael sher@@ mer &lt; / speaker &gt;
sir , do you want to empty your po@@ ckets , please , sir ?
or is it more likely that a rea@@ der of &quot; s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic &quot; did this with pho@@ tos@@ h@@ op ?
first of all , there was no theory of plan@@ et@@ ary r@@ ings .
religious ic@@ on@@ o@@ graphy .
anybody can do it , turns out .
so i will end with the new version .
and , once again , i got an extraordinary education ,
man : when we were at home , it was kon@@ y &apos;s &#91; re@@ bel &#93; soldiers di@@ stur@@ bing us .
and that may or may not be true -- i didn &apos;t think he was a li@@ ar , though .
in a sense the small , port@@ able , d@@ v c@@ am was really what allowed it to come into being .
and what that &apos;s done is it &apos;s created , like i said , a vi@@ br@@ ant community that &apos;s very inclu@@ sive , with people continu@@ ally working to connect musical ideas , innov@@ ate them and keep things constantly up to date .
and i think if you could do this , it would be called -- i &apos;m just going to ref@@ er to it as a knowledge ecosystem .
because just provi@@ ding free content to people has actually been li@@ ken@@ ed by people in the developing world to a kind of cultural im@@ peri@@ alism --
and i think that this is an extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting area because there is tremendous area under this long tail in publi@@ shing .
and i &apos;ll just give you my personal story .
the creative comm@@ ons licen@@ ses .
so this is a little bit of a problem . so we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control
that way you could listen to cool music while you pre@@ tend to look for a job and you &apos;re really just ch@@ att@@ in &apos; with your p@@ als .
you don &apos;t write a p@@ sal@@ m .
i &apos;ll begin with this concept of what i call dna .
this is the final product . when they sent it to me , i thought i &apos;d failed .
this is a scan through the human for@@ ear@@ m . it &apos;s then blo@@ wn up through rap@@ id proto@@ typ@@ ing to reve@@ al its cel@@ lu@@ lar structure . i have these in my office .
this is an absolutely beautiful way of working .
and i can hear gre@@ g ly@@ n@@ n laugh@@ ing his so@@ cks off as i say that .
so i try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio .
you take them off your wall , you plu@@ g them in . off you go .
and this is a car@@ bon@@ -@@ fi@@ ber hand@@ ra@@ il which is only suppor@@ ted in two places .
the first sculp@@ tur@@ al model i made for that thing in to@@ k@@ yo .
&lt; / doc &gt;
the way the t@@ v-@@ industrial complex works , is you buy some ads , inter@@ ru@@ pt some people , that gets you distribution .
because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
every week , the number one be@@ st-@@ selling d@@ v@@ d in america changes .
that &apos;s what mass marketing is .
these guys make the lou@@ dest car stere@@ o in the world .
oh , you like my ring ? it &apos;s my grandmother .
now , at coun@@ t@@ less meet@@ ings at , you know , the port@@ land city coun@@ cil , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get frank ge@@ h@@ ry ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : &quot; fre@@ a@@ kon@@ om@@ ics &quot; auth@@ or steven le@@ vit@@ t presen@@ ts new data on the fin@@ an@@ ces of drug dealing . contr@@ ary to popular my@@ th , he says , being a stre@@ et-@@ corner cr@@ ack de@@ al@@ er isn &apos;t lu@@ cra@@ tive : it pa@@ ys below minim@@ um wa@@ ge . and your bos@@ s can kill you .
you couldn &apos;t sell coca@@ ine ;
not really me -- i &apos;m really a bit player in all this .
he was held ho@@ stage over@@ night in the sta@@ ir@@ well .
but they had seen movies like &quot; wall street , &quot; and they had learned a little bit about what it was like to be in the real world .
it was below the minim@@ um wa@@ ge . and this is well-@@ documen@@ ted .
so for compar@@ ison &apos;s pur@@ poses , let &apos;s think about some other walk of life you may expect might be extremely ri@@ sky .
but the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
it &apos;s exactly this concept .
thank you very much .
and then the child turned two , and i started using the cheap and easy treatment , and i wonder &quot; --
and the free cure is adult seat@@ bel@@ ts , and the expensive cure -- the 3@@ 00@@ -@@ milli@@ on-@@ dol@@ lar@@ -@@ a-@@ year cure -- is child car se@@ ats .
and what you find is that the car se@@ ats and the lap@@ -@@ and-@@ shoul@@ der bel@@ ts , when it comes to saving lives , fat@@ alities look exactly iden@@ tical .
and so , we went to buff@@ al@@ o , new york , and here is the pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or to it .
so this car seat was actually an abo@@ ve-@@ average car seat from consumer repor@@ ts , and did quite well .
it &apos;s just actually -- you see , this is fol@@ ding up -- it &apos;s behind the seat .
is there any data to show that child se@@ ats are actually less effective , or just as effective as seat@@ bel@@ ts for serious in@@ jury ? because that would prove your case . )
let me start some place . i &apos;m interested -- i kind of do the same thing , but i don &apos;t move my body . and instead of using human figu@@ res to develop ideas of time and space ,
and that directly connec@@ ts to ideas of cit@@ y-@@ making .
this is the cal@@ tr@@ ans building in los angeles .
and then -- well , he was probably looking at this -- this is na@@ z@@ ca ; this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four@@ -@@ kilometer land sculp@@ tures .
and that the building itself is occu@@ pi@@ ed in the lower por@@ tion , broken up by a series of cour@@ ts , and it &apos;s five ac@@ res of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted , hori@@ z@@ ont@@ al space for their administ@@ ra@@ tive off@@ ices .
well , then we get to this image .
while creation sometimes seems a bit un@@ -@@ gra@@ sp@@ able , or even poin@@ t@@ less , creativity is always meaningful .
the first person was wearing a black tie , a tu@@ x@@ e@@ do . it was me .
but i was still , you know -- this is a kit@@ ty cloud .
this is &quot; 6@@ ,@@ 500 y@@ ards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 y@@ ards , &quot; after ger@@ hard ri@@ chter .
this is richard ser@@ ra .
in theater , you have the character and the actor in the same place , trying to negoti@@ ate each other in front of an audience .
and this happens every two weeks .
so , two months later , i went into ti@@ bet , and i started intervie@@ wing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
and he still is holding this line .
one of the things i did just before 9 / 11 -- augu@@ st of 2001 -- i took my son , da@@ x , who was 16 at the time , and i took him to pakistan .
and the way we &apos;ve done this -- we teach digital story@@ telling to these kids .
and this kid lived in the village -- he wasn &apos;t there at the time -- and this is the little movie he put together about that .
and my mother was i@@ ri@@ sh ca@@ tho@@ lic , and -- but she didn &apos;t take religion too seriously .
you can read it in about two hours .
the people from london came up .
we ru@@ shed over to the chemistry department and said , &quot; could pa@@ ul@@ ing be right ? &quot; and ale@@ x hu@@ st said , &quot; no . &quot; so we were happy .
it &apos;s the order of the four bas@@ es .
and so i didn &apos;t really get happy until 1960 , because then we found out , basically , you know , that there are three forms of r@@ na .
but wi@@ g@@ ler , be@@ sides looking at cancer cells , looked at normal cells , and made a really sort of surprising observ@@ ation .
now , we don &apos;t have really any evidence of it , but i think , to give you a hypothe@@ sis , the best guess is that if you &apos;re le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand@@ ed , you &apos;re pr@@ one to schi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
and at certain points we were walking around , he gra@@ b@@ bed my hand for support , which is something most ken@@ y@@ ans would never consider doing .
&quot; arm@@ strong expla@@ ined the bru@@ tal reality of their situation : they paid 1,@@ 500 sh@@ ill@@ ings in r@@ ent , about 20 bu@@ cks a month , a relatively high price for a ken@@ yan sh@@ an@@ ty@@ town , and they could not afford to be late with the money .
&apos;@@ once you have sta@@ yed here , &apos; he said , &apos; you can stay for the rest of your life . &apos; &quot; so , he has hope , and this is where these communities start .
this is the main drag of ro@@ cin@@ ha , the est@@ ra@@ da da ga@@ ve@@ a , and there &apos;s a bus route that runs through it , lots of people out on the street .
and that little hu@@ t right there has a pu@@ mp in it , and that &apos;s what people do :
and there were three old ladies who lived in -- that &apos;s her self-@@ built house behind her -- and they &apos;ve lived there for 30 or 40 years ,
but if you know anything about the history of brit@@ an@@ ni@@ ca since 196@@ 2 , it was anything but radical : still a very completely safe , sto@@ d@@ gy type of en@@ cycl@@ ope@@ dia .
how popular we &apos;ve gotten to be -- we &apos;re a top@@ -@@ 50 website and we &apos;re more popular than the new york times .
so the big question when you &apos;ve got this really cha@@ o@@ tic organization is , why isn &apos;t it all ru@@ bb@@ ish ? why is the website as good as it is ?
and it wasn &apos;t because they were con@@ ten@@ tious ; it was just because there was rou@@ t@@ ine vand@@ alism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... sometimes even repor@@ ters have repor@@ ted to me that they vand@@ alized wikipedia and were ama@@ zed that it was fix@@ ed so quickly .
so you can go to a certain page of wikipedia and see every new page as it &apos;s created .
when somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone , an anony@@ mous i@@ p number , made an e@@ dit to my page . that sounds susp@@ ici@@ ous . who is this person ? somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see high@@ ligh@@ ted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see , ok , well , these words have changed , things like this .
and it also matters who the people are who are vo@@ ting .
it just isn &apos;t appropriate .
it stri@@ kes me that much of the tex@@ t@@ books that are used to educ@@ ate our children are inher@@ ently bi@@ ased .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 3@@ 8 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and , i noticed that most inven@@ tions fail , not because the r &amp; amp ; d department can &apos;t get it to work -- if you look at most business pl@@ ans , they will actually succe@@ ed if given the opportunity to build what they say they &apos;re going to build -- and 90 percent of those projects or more will fail , because the ti@@ ming is wrong -- not all the enab@@ ling factors will be in place when they &apos;re needed .
it took us half a century to adop@@ t the tele@@ phone , the first virtu@@ al-@@ reality technology .
and that &apos;s a very profound expl@@ osi@@ on of exponenti@@ al growth .
you would think it would be a very er@@ ra@@ tic process , and you have a very sm@@ oo@@ th outcome of this cha@@ o@@ tic process .
that was in the interests of the species tens of thousands of years ago .
with super@@ -@@ computing simu@@ lations , where actually there are scientists building molecu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
but then the question is , ok , we can get this data now , but can we understand it ?
it &apos;ll be millions of times more powerful than it is today .
they both em@@ power our promise and our per@@ il .
that &apos;s very good news , because i thought that was what the answer would be .
and therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . &quot;
this is not a completely tau@@ t@@ ological statement ; it &apos;s a reas@@ on@@ able statement .
fundamental break@@ through@@ s : very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take to make a fundamental break@@ through .
but ir@@ respec@@ tive of that age , i &apos;m cla@@ im@@ ing that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastro@@ ph@@ es -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years youn@@ ger than the first 1@@ 50@@ -year-old .
they &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
this list is just for illu@@ stra@@ tion ; it is in@@ complete .
so of course , there are some biolo@@ gists in the audience , and i want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
a@@ g : because i am an old man . i am actually 15@@ 8 .
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
i went down to a remote la@@ g@@ oon in australia , hop@@ ing to see the earth the way it was three billion years ago , back before the sky turned blue .
stro@@ mat@@ ol@@ ites were the first to ex@@ h@@ ale oxygen .
life turned hard so it could venture in@@ land .
when the ski@@ es clear@@ ed , a new world was born .
and where water is liqu@@ id , it becomes a wom@@ b
and at some point i &apos;ll even pass around what the $ 100 laptop might be like .
a little bit more recently , i got involved personally .
we &apos;re interested in perfect color uni@@ form@@ ity .
that can drop to eight ; it can drop to seven
is it all worked out ? no .
so i can &apos;t quite name them .
it looks like a post-@@ office truck .
that &apos;s a pretty so@@ ft land@@ ing . thank you .
each one is like a sun with a re@@ tin@@ ue of planets or@@ b@@ iting around it . and we can see places where stars are forming , like the ea@@ gle ne@@ bu@@ la . we see stars dying .
stars are fu@@ el@@ ed by how the nu@@ cle@@ i in those atoms re@@ act together .
we dep@@ end on stars to make the atoms we &apos;re made of .
indeed , catastro@@ p@@ he could ari@@ se simply from technical mis@@ ad@@ venture -- er@@ ror rather than ter@@ ror .
i wrote my book , &quot; our final century , &quot; as a scientist , just a general scientist . but there &apos;s one respect , i think , in which being a cos@@ m@@ ologist off@@ ered a special perspective ,
the contin@@ en@@ tal land@@ mass@@ es dri@@ f@@ ted around .
&lt; speaker &gt; paul ben@@ net@@ t &lt; / speaker &gt;
and they were sort , you know , blin@@ ding gli@@ mp@@ se of ble@@ eding obvious .
i &apos;m going to read this because i want to get these names right .
we use this phra@@ se &quot; wor@@ kar@@ ounds &quot; a lot , sort of , looking around us . i was actually looking around the ted and just watching all of these kind of things happen while i &apos;ve been here .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
again , that &apos;s one of the the@@ mes that i think has come through l@@ oud and clear in this conference
ted talk subtitles and transcript : viol@@ in@@ ist si@@ ren@@ a hu@@ ang gives a techni@@ cally brilliant and emo@@ tionally nu@@ an@@ ced performance . in a char@@ ming inter@@ lu@@ de , the 1@@ 1@@ -year-old pra@@ is@@ es the ti@@ mel@@ ess design of her instrument .
the viol@@ in is very beautiful .
thank you .
how do i comp@@ ose ?
anyone to come up here and choose five --
david deu@@ ts@@ ch : chemical sc@@ um that dream of di@@ stant qu@@ as@@ ars
can we have the lights off , please , so we can see it ?
that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be , can ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless em@@ body the same mathematical and cau@@ s@@ al structure and to do it more and more so over time .
probably the har@@ dest science to do would be biology field tri@@ ps -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the ne@@ ar@@ est life@@ -@@ be@@ aring planet and back .
and the actions that are advoc@@ ated are not even pur@@ por@@ ted to solve the problem , mer@@ ely to post@@ p@@ one it by a little . so it &apos;s already too late to avoid it , and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger .
&lt; speaker &gt; jos@@ hu@@ a prin@@ ce-@@ ra@@ mu@@ s &lt; / speaker &gt;
they can be pu@@ shed off@@ -@@ center a little bit , but in the end you actually still get as much of that original spectrum as you origin@@ ally had hop@@ ed .
our first oper@@ ation was to re-@@ di@@ gest it back to them , show it to them and say , &quot; you know what ? we haven &apos;t tou@@ ched it , but only one-@@ third of your own program is dedic@@ ated to media and books .
it just so happens to be on the 6@@ th through 10@@ th flo@@ ors of the building , but that is not necessarily an expensive approach .
and now up .
we invest the money in the oper@@ ation of the building .

my brother had this great y@@ ama@@ ha motor@@ cycle that he was willing to bor@@ row to me fre@@ ely .
a happy dog -- and you take it out , it &apos;s an aggre@@ ssive dog .
op@@ ens up at du@@ s@@ k and da@@ wn every day .
well , there was a question , of course , that was on my mind for a while : you know , can i do more of the things that i like doing in design and less of the ones that i don &apos;t like to be doing ?
this is from the front .
and it was co-@@ spon@@ sor@@ ed by the pen@@ ta@@ g@@ on -- it &apos;s independent , it &apos;s pe@@ er-@@ revie@@ wed and all of the back@@ up cal@@ cu@@ lations are transpar@@ ently po@@ sted for your per@@ us@@ al .
the more we keep on using the oil , particularly the im@@ por@@ ted oil , the more we face a very obvious ar@@ ray of problems .
and can , indeed , be done administ@@ ra@@ tively or at a state level .
this is not very gra@@ ti@@ fying after more than a century of de@@ vo@@ ted engineering effort .
they sna@@ p together like a kid &apos;s to@@ y .
you &apos;re not paid to change size class .
the same for the modern se@@ mi@@ -@@ conduc@@ tor industry .

unfortunately , race and class are extremely reli@@ able indi@@ cat@@ ors as to where one might find the good stuff , like par@@ ks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste fac@@ ili@@ ties .
these things make me different from you .
anti@@ qu@@ ated zon@@ ing and land@@ -@@ use regu@@ lations are still used to this day
we also built new york city &apos;s first green and cool roof demonstra@@ tion project on top of our off@@ ices .
and we are operating with a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive ur@@ ban@@ -@@ planning de@@ fic@@ it .
but as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflec@@ ting their da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day lives , incredible things happened .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore re@@ min@@ ded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wa@@ sting our energy , intelligence and har@@ d-@@ ear@@ ned experience to that count .
that led to a number of proto@@ types being built and really experimen@@ ting with some ideas .
so that means , you know , somebody who &apos;s based in mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i knows more about mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i than i do . so what happened is , we used mee@@ tu@@ p and all these other internet tools , and we ended up having 40 chap@@ ters starting up , thousands of architec@@ ts in 10@@ 4 countries .
within three days , we realized the problem was not hou@@ sing ; it was the growing pande@@ mic of hiv / aids .
so this is about getting an economic engine , and then at night , it turns into a movie theater .
so when you come to ted@@ global , you can check it out .
we &apos;ve had over 1,@@ 500 volunte@@ ers re@@ building , re@@ ha@@ bb@@ ing homes .
this is a gri@@ p clip , designed by somebody who said , &quot; all you need is some way to att@@ ach me@@ m@@ bran@@ e structures

when i hear about the $ 100 laptop and it &apos;s going to educ@@ ate every child -- educ@@ ate every designer in the world . put one in every fa@@ vel@@ a , every slu@@ m sett@@ le@@ ment . because you know what ? innovation will happen .

this is my mother and a@@ unt teaching don@@ na how to ride a bi@@ ke .
i got dra@@ wn into this community and i began to take pictures there .
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding or know how to move together into the future ?
it was absolutely re@@ vol@@ ting .
in the united states , i was blo@@ wn away by the motiv@@ ations , the positive motiv@@ ations of the american people when they &apos;d see this film .
&#91; may god for@@ give you . &#93;
&#91; george : but there is a teacher that is in charge ? &#93;
and that &apos;s an amazing thing .
there are people that want to be a part of this global day of film ; to be able to provide a platform for independent voices and independent films to get out there .
walk around for four months with three wis@@ h@@ es , and all the ideas will start to per@@ col@@ ate up .
and that became one of the most sur@@ real landsc@@ apes i &apos;ve ever seen . totally trans@@ formed by man .
and it gets people to enter it . and it also , in a way , defin@@ es kind of what i feel , too --
and i thought , &quot; my god , wouldn &apos;t that be something ? &quot;
and what was also one of the bigger projects around that was moving 13 ful@@ l-@@ size cities up out of the reser@@ vo@@ ir , and f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ing all the buildings so they could make way for the ships .
you &apos;re seeing the tu@@ x@@ e@@ do@@ s , the bou@@ que@@ ts .
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years , or maybe even thousands of years ,
it &apos;s brea@@ th@@ taking , in terms of the speed at which this city is trans@@ forming .
and what you &apos;re seeing here is , again , one of the most stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art tex@@ ti@@ le mil@@ ls .
while setting up this shot , people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch .
i want to dedic@@ ate my wis@@ h@@ es to my two girls .
they could be po@@ sted through the web ;
and i also thought there should be a nice prize for the best art@@ work for &quot; in my world . &quot; and what would happen -- it &apos;s a sc@@ al@@ able thing . and if we can get people to put in things --
i &apos;m too bu@@ sy . so i need somebody who can put me on a quick cat@@ ch@@ -up course on how to do something like that ,
someone saw me on television ; they called me up ; and they asked me if i &apos;d like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride from san francisco to england . and i said , yes , i would do that , so i became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie called &quot; medicine ball car@@ a@@ van . &quot;
you should see it from the perspective of a mother , watching her child develop this disease and standing by hel@@ ple@@ ss@@ ly .
but in that year , small@@ po@@ x explo@@ ded throughout india .
but small@@ po@@ x was the fourth disease that was inten@@ ded for era@@ dic@@ ation .
and we had aston@@ ishing results .
and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars would be far worse for everyone than mer@@ ely 100 million people dying ,
hel@@ lo , ron !
and we &apos;ll add g@@ ap@@ minder &apos;s amazing graph@@ ics to the front end .
and now , their repor@@ ting percentage is down to 50 percent , because other nations have started to report .
you can , it turns out , be in two places at once .
another very t@@ all , gri@@ zz@@ led rock star , my friend sir bob gel@@ d@@ of , issu@@ ed a challenge to &quot; feed the world . &quot;
that &apos;s not a cause . that &apos;s an emergen@@ cy .
not here , not in america , not in europe .
now when the military are telling us that this is a war that cannot be won by military might alone , maybe we should listen .
well , much more than we think .
most of you did , the digital world .
we believe this is one .
and we &apos;d like you to give us that energy .
i wish for you to help build a social movement of more than one million american activi@@ sts for africa .
this has to be described as an ad@@ venture , not a bur@@ den .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
so my grand@@ father told me when i was a little girl , &quot; if you say a word often enough , it becomes you . &quot;
well , some of you are laugh@@ ing . everybody laugh@@ s when i say that , but not on this train . silence .
so the human touch , you see , it &apos;s dis@@ appe@@ aring .
and this is an in@@ mate named pau@@ let@@ te jen@@ kins .
her face was bru@@ is@@ ed . she had a black eye .
everybody knows that the los angeles ri@@ o@@ ts happened because four cop@@ s beat up a black man named ro@@ d@@ ney king .
i was sitting here watching them the morning after the ver@@ dic@@ t , and all the day they were having a party , they celebr@@ ated , all of south central , all the chur@@ ches . and they say , &apos; well , finally justice has been done in this society . &apos;
and i &apos;ve been going to the ro@@ de@@ os with him , and we &apos;ve bon@@ ded .
i mean , like , p@@ at o &apos;@@ me@@ al@@ ey always said when i was a boy , he say , &apos; you know , you got more try than any kid i ever seen . &apos;
&lt; speaker &gt; steven john@@ son &lt; / speaker &gt;
because if we get it out of the streets , it &apos;ll smell much better , and -- oh right , we drink from the river .
just an extraordinary , terri@@ fying scene .
and that was the last time that london has seen a chol@@ era out@@ break since .
there &apos;s a billion people without clean drin@@ king water .
to climate change that would be like k@@ yo@@ to .
it could be at one dollar ; it could be 1,000 dollars .
that is what econom@@ ists do .
so the guy in bangla@@ desh who gets a fl@@ ood in 2@@ 100 can wait until 2@@ 10@@ 6 .
this third best one was free trade .
we should also do climate change , if for no other reason , simply because it &apos;s such a big problem .
the other objec@@ tions , i think , that are important to say , is that i &apos;m somehow -- or we are somehow -- pos@@ iting a fal@@ se choice .
and that gives me great hope , really , in saying that i do believe that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about pri@@ orities ,
because traditional economic theory would say , well , the mountain bi@@ ke was probably invented by some big bi@@ ke corpor@@ ation that had a big r &amp; amp ; d lab where they were thinking up new projects , and it came out of there . it didn &apos;t come from there .
build creative clu@@ sters in cities ; create more r &amp; amp ; d par@@ ks , so on and so forth .
big corpor@@ ations have an in-@@ built ten@@ den@@ cy to re@@ in@@ force past success .
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
because the profession@@ als , over here in these closed organizations -- they might be acade@@ mic@@ s ; they might be programm@@ ers ; they might be doctors ; they might be journali@@ sts -- my former profes@@ sion -- say , &quot; no , no -- you can &apos;t trust these people over here . &quot; when i started in journ@@ alism -- financial times , 20 years ago -- it was very , very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper .
so it &apos;s not going to be a con@@ test between two cam@@ ps , but , in between them , you &apos;ll find all sorts of interesting places that people will occu@@ p@@ y .
or you can get on a plane , fly to sh@@ angha@@ i , qu@@ eu@@ e up outside sh@@ anda &apos;s off@@ ices -- cost probably 600 , 700 dollars -- and rec@@ la@@ im your character , get your history back .
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other va@@ gin@@ as .
&quot; hur@@ ry , nur@@ se , bring the vagina ! &quot;
there are three qu@@ alities i want to talk about .
and in one year , it went to 50 colle@@ ges , and then it expand@@ ed .
and i was thinking about how being with these extraordinary people on this particular pan@@ el ,
and she applied , hop@@ ing that she would become a fin@@ ali@@ st and she could bring her sister .
and she walked through the ri@@ ft valley , and she had vagina and vagina replac@@ ement parts , where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls what a healthy vagina looks like , and what a mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed vagina looks like . and in the course of her travel -- she walked literally for eight years through the ri@@ ft valley , through du@@ st , through sleep@@ ing on the ground , because the maa@@ sa@@ i are n@@ om@@ ads ,
and in the maa@@ sa@@ i community , go@@ ats and co@@ ws are the most valu@@ ed pos@@ se@@ ssion .
this thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time .
there &apos;s no manu@@ al . this is exactly what you expect , especially if you haven &apos;t interac@@ ted with a computer before .
as you can see , i can use the same two-@@ fing@@ ered ge@@ stu@@ res to go down and go in really se@@ am@@ less@@ ly . there &apos;s no interface , again .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agre@@ ed , non@@ eth@@ eless , on the really extraordinary capac@@ i@@ ties that children have -- their capac@@ i@@ ties for innovation .
what we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original --
this was the love of his life , sara@@ h .
they &apos;re just a form of life ,
and i think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
i &apos;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot; ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any , &quot; which is based on a series of intervie@@ ws with people about how they discovered their talent .
people who had to move to think . &quot; who had to move to think . they did ball@@ et , they did ta@@ p , ja@@ zz ; they did modern ; they did con@@ temporary .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 7 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
we &apos;re not top on people &apos;s li@@ sts for dinner party gu@@ est@@ s and convers@@ ations and so on .
so you might think there are more interesting things to do , but humor me for the moment .
and you might be rel@@ ie@@ ved to know even rather di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ished mathema@@ ti@@ cians think that .
you &apos;re a little bit excited with the first head -- you get rather more excited with the next tail .
and i will give you two little s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in oxford ,
what &apos;s the chance that they do ?
one explan@@ ation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is un@@ likely .
unfortunately here -- and , really , re@@ gre@@ tt@@ ably -- first of all , in a situation like this you &apos;d have to ver@@ i@@ fy it empi@@ ri@@ cally .
now , we probably think a pri@@ or@@ i that &apos;s un@@ likely .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re bad at doing .
&lt; / doc &gt;
a lot of you have heard the term &quot; me@@ mes . &quot; the evolution of technology , i pay a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things you got was a little hand ax@@ e .
a lot of forms of non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum behavior in the real@@ m of economics and so on in everyday life often leads to cooper@@ ation .
but i assu@@ me that in business class , you don &apos;t hear many ex@@ pressi@@ ons of , you know , bi@@ go@@ try about rac@@ ial groups or eth@@ ni@@ c groups , because the people who are flying trans@@ -@@ atlan@@ tic business class are doing business with all these people ; they &apos;re making money off all these people . and i really do think that , in that sense at least , capit@@ alism has been a construc@@ tive force ,
i think we &apos;re going to have to have a major round of moral progress in the world .
to really understand it , you &apos;ve got to say , &quot; oh , i get it .
which at the time , was a pretty high-@@ level social organization .
and i &apos;m going to tell you what really leads to success and makes ted@@ sters tic@@ k .
a lot of kids want to be milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res .
and i &apos;m often asked , &quot; why do you think so many people have read this ?
as a pa@@ st@@ or , i do see a lot of koo@@ ks .
and then when i wrote this book , and all of a sudden , it just took off , and i started saying , now , what &apos;s the purpose of this ?
and so , you need to understand what your world@@ view is .
and having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of fun@@ er@@ als , it makes a difference .
it doesn &apos;t come from sal@@ ary .
your value is not based on your valu@@ ab@@ les . it &apos;s based on a whole different set of things .
number one , god never does a mi@@ rac@@ le to show off .
what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
why would god wire you to do something and then not have you do it ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : chris anderson , then the edi@@ tor of wired , explor@@ es the four key sta@@ ges of any vi@@ able technology : setting the right price , ga@@ ining market share , disp@@ lac@@ ing an establi@@ shed technology and , finally , becoming u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
and at each one of these sta@@ ges , can be seen as a colli@@ sion -- a colli@@ sion with something else -- for example , a critical pri@@ ce-@@ line that changes both the technology and also changes its effect on the world . it &apos;s an inf@@ lec@@ tion point .
that gave an advantage ; that was an implic@@ ation of the technology &apos;s rise that wasn &apos;t obvious to everybody .
and the f@@ alling price of drugs has a lot to do with that .
they already have nearly four million regi@@ ster@@ ed users -- that &apos;s critical mass .
thank you .
i mean , these are sort of the extreme examples , and they &apos;re am@@ using and good to lau@@ gh at .
the first was , how did we get so fast ?
and , in this kind of ca@@ ul@@ dro@@ n of moments and places and acts of de@@ celer@@ ation , lie what a lot of people now ref@@ er to as the &quot; international slow movement . &quot;
i mean , the poin@@ ter si@@ sters said it most el@@ o@@ qu@@ ently , didn &apos;t they ,
so wher@@ ever you look , the message , it seems to me , is the same :
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and sa@@ vor your life .
i find that 10 minutes into a story , you know , my son will suddenly say , &quot; you know , something happened in the play@@ ground today that really bo@@ ther@@ ed me . &quot;
so , you know , sustain@@ ability , small planet .
a third of the people on this planet are kids .
we &apos;re already an urban planet ; that &apos;s especially true in the developed world .
if you &apos;re somebody who drives , you know , one day a week , do you really need your own car ?
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
and one of the things we &apos;re really , really interested in at world@@ changing is the ways in which the south is re-@@ identi@@ fying itself , and re-@@ categ@@ ori@@ zing itself in ways that have less and less to do with most of us in this room .
another example of this sort of second super@@ power thing is the rise of these games that are what we call &quot; serious play . &quot;
here &apos;s a fo@@ g-@@ cat@@ ch@@ er , which , if you live in a mo@@ ist , jun@@ g@@ le-@@ like area , will di@@ still water from the air that &apos;s clean and drin@@ k@@ able .
i also love it because it seems to me that the example , the tools we use to change the world , ought to be beautiful in themselves .
think about that number : 8@@ 3 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries .
in that context a gentle@@ man came to my office at that time .
trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should oper@@ ate like a media bank .
that means that they have no sports ; they have no lat@@ est news ; circu@@ lation goes down .
and i could spend hours talking about them , because they &apos;re all kind of heroes .
so it sounds like a great story .
but the point is , if we ever survive to actually issue them , find enough inve@@ stors that this can be considered a success , there &apos;s nothing stop@@ ping the next organization to start to issue bon@@ ds next spring .
&lt; speaker &gt; su@@ san sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ ru@@ mb@@ au@@ gh &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s in our biology ; i think we &apos;ve at@@ tribu@@ ted it to our biology , but i don &apos;t really think it &apos;s there .
none of the things you will see in this particular video are trained .
ss : he talks to other bon@@ o@@ bos at the lab , long-@@ distance , far@@ ther than we can hear .
kan@@ zi &apos;s rock is from gon@@ a , ethiop@@ ia and is iden@@ tical to that used by our african ance@@ stors two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half million years ago .
video : this le@@ xi@@ gram also ref@@ ers to a place in the woo@@ ds .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
&lt; / doc &gt;
so , the s@@ ma@@ sh@@ er rap@@ tori@@ al app@@ en@@ da@@ ge can sta@@ b with a point at the end , or it can s@@ ma@@ sh with the heel .
so that was really cool and very un@@ expected .
so , we &apos;ve had very so@@ lid evidence showing that that sa@@ dd@@ le-@@ shaped structure actually com@@ pre@@ sses and exten@@ ds , and does , in fact , function as a spring .
and again , that brings us back to the importance of that spring in stor@@ ing up and releas@@ ing so much energy in this system .
you can see it coming in , and an incredible fla@@ sh of light , and all this ca@@ vit@@ ation spre@@ ading over the surface of the sna@@ il .
and also the mil@@ ler institute for basic research in science , which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time , and for that i &apos;m very grat@@ eful . thank you very much .
we can viol@@ ate your expect@@ ations on represen@@ tation -- what an image represents . what do you see here ?
that when you saw from one little angle was like
so , if you measu@@ red them , they would be . and as i say , those two figu@@ res are iden@@ tical in size and shape .
and so you can see , the real process of -- and this is bac@@ ked up by this 50@@ 0-@@ page book -- that the auth@@ orities came down and citizens got up .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
and chris is a fis@@ her@@ man farm@@ er . both are gener@@ ali@@ sts .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s lac@@ king in a poor country .
even in bangla@@ desh , there are some empty places .
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot;
it turns out that what this stuff is -- and richard da@@ w@@ kins has written about this -- is , this is really a river out of e@@ den .
so , this little th@@ ing@@ ama@@ j@@ ig has a genome that &apos;s 200 times the size of y@@ ours .
and the reason why they &apos;re ancient is because this thing came up when this planet was covered by things like sul@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id in batter@@ ies , and it was eating i@@ ron when the earth was part of a mel@@ ted core .
it takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time .
why would cli@@ ff be doing that ? he doesn &apos;t have a restaurant .
that &apos;s what your genes are doing every day .
well , it turns out that there &apos;s about 27 trillion bits moving inside from the united states to the united states ; about 4@@ .@@ 6 trillion is going over to those european countries ; about 5@@ .@@ 5 &apos;s going to japan ; there &apos;s almost no communication between japan , and nobody else is liter@@ ate in this stuff .
that &apos;s why nations rise and fall .
and it &apos;s all getting very frag@@ mented . and this has not stopped .
♫ oh please , oh please , oh please me right ♫ ♫ i want what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have what i don &apos;t have , what i want ♫ ♫ what i can &apos;t have , need what i can &apos;t want ♫ ♫ have but i don &apos;t have -- you know that ♫ ♫ my mind won &apos;t stop , and my heart says go ♫ ♫ nobody knows how to hold me , no ♫
that &apos;s an in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence compared to having both of them gone . &quot;
it also has a p@@ neu@@ matic cu@@ ff that hol@@ ds it on , so the more they put themselves under load , the more it atta@@ ches . they take the load off , and it becomes , again , compli@@ ant .
as a little boy , and through my teen@@ age years , i became increasingly fascin@@ ated by the diversity of life .
and mor@@ e@@ over , responsible for a large part of the pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sis that occur@@ s in the ocean .
and that may be just the beginning !
i found my ma@@ gical ants , but only after a tough clim@@ b into the mountains where the last of the n@@ ative cu@@ ban forests hun@@ g on , and were then -- and still are -- being cut back .
we ur@@ gen@@ tly need to change this .
it will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity .
it puts a human face on issues which from af@@ ar can appear abstract or ide@@ ological or monu@@ mental in their global impact .
an anti-@@ sand@@ in@@ ist@@ a gu@@ err@@ illa was mor@@ tally w@@ ounded as comm@@ ander zero attac@@ ked a town in southern ni@@ car@@ a@@ gu@@ a .
farmers were driven off their land , and cro@@ ps and li@@ ve@@ stock were destro@@ yed or st@@ olen .
the im@@ print of a man who had been bur@@ ned inside his own home .
these hero@@ in addic@@ ts in de@@ to@@ x in pakistan re@@ min@@ ded me of figu@@ res in a play by be@@ cke@@ tt : isol@@ ated , waiting in the dark , but dra@@ wn to the light .
a few minutes later when i looked again and saw the second to@@ wer bur@@ ning , i knew we were at war .
i tried to imagine myself in their place , and i was totally hu@@ mb@@ led by their coura@@ ge and determin@@ ation in the face of such catastro@@ phi@@ c loss .
the percentage of working families without health care up by four percent .
none in india . there are now at least a half a million active .
that children &apos;s medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year .
so what we have been trying to do , working first in rwanda and then in mal@@ aw@@ i and other places -- but i want to talk about rwanda ton@@ ight -- is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area that can be used to deal with aids , t@@ b , malaria , other infec@@ tious diseases , mat@@ ern@@ al and child health , and a whole range of health issues poor people are grap@@ pl@@ ing with in the developing world ,
and the results were so good that the r@@ wand@@ an government has now agre@@ ed to adop@@ t the model for the entire country , and has stron@@ g@@ ly suppor@@ ted and put the full resources of the government behind it .
about 40 percent of all the people who need t@@ b treatment are now getting it --
i am grat@@ eful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
how could it not have sun@@ k in when they &apos;d been telling me ?
i just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven , and then you &apos;re capable of commit@@ ting any and all sin@@ s against god and man . &quot; and bill said , &quot; so ? &quot; and i said , &quot; so , you &apos;re six . you have a whole year to do anything you want to and god won &apos;t notice it . &quot; and he said , &quot; so ? &quot;
now , i just live off a main th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ f@@ are in los angeles , and my block is -- well , it &apos;s a natural beginning for people who are pe@@ dd@@ ling things door to door .
then they told me how le@@ hi and his de@@ scen@@ dan@@ ts re@@ produced and re@@ produced , and over the course of 600 years , there were two great rac@@ es of them , the ne@@ ph@@ ites and the lam@@ an@@ ites , and the ne@@ ph@@ ites were totally good -- each and every one of them -- and the lam@@ an@@ ites were totally bad and evil -- every single one of them just bad to the bone .
well , then they didn &apos;t look so fre@@ sh@@ -@@ fac@@ ed and cu@@ te to me any more , but they had more to say .
&lt; / doc &gt;
the only assi@@ stance i need from you , which i know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a sil@@ ent partner and recei@@ ve the fun@@ ds in your account in trust ;
but they said , &quot; no , but don &apos;t show anyone . &quot; but they sli@@ pped up .
and i know what you &apos;re saying , &quot; ho@@ ly cra@@ p ! how is his presen@@ tation so sm@@ oo@@ th ? &quot;
but you come back as a duc@@ k .
in fact , it &apos;s tun@@ ed to be better at drawing things that look worse . so , we go ahead , and we start scri@@ bb@@ ling .
this is me . my name is ben sa@@ un@@ ders .

on a wi@@ der scale , i hope that this journey was a chance to in@@ sp@@ ire other people to think about what they want to do with their potential , and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time we each have on this planet .
ladies and gentlemen , that &apos;s my story .
on the left was post@@ script being ren@@ dered by a conven@@ tional computer ;
but all our fabri@@ c@@ ation is down in this lower left corner .
so , these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to di@@ giti@@ ze fabri@@ c@@ ation . computers that don &apos;t control tools but computers that are tools , where the out@@ put of a program re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ges atoms as well as bits .
ken ol@@ sen fam@@ ously said , nobody needs a computer in the home .
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sens@@ or .
they were tens of thousands of dollars , hard to use , but they brought computing down to work groups ,
the real opportunity is to har@@ ness the inven@@ tive power of the world to loc@@ ally design and produce solutions to local problems .
until one day in nin@@ th grade , when i was standing with a number of the foot@@ ball players .
and the good news was that the institu@@ tion , the ban@@ king institu@@ tion , la@@ sted .
they typically pay for critical goods and services like water , like healthcare , like hou@@ sing , and they pay 30 to 40 times what their midd@@ lec@@ la@@ ss counter@@ parts pay -- certainly where we work in kar@@ ach@@ i and nai@@ ro@@ bi .
the question , though , is not &quot; why can &apos;t we ? &quot; the question is how can we help afri@@ c@@ ans do this for themselves ?
she brought 10 of the women with whom she interac@@ ts together to see if she could sell these ne@@ ts , five dollars ap@@ ie@@ ce , despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one , and we learned a lot about how you sell things .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ graduate course called global health .
&quot; well , that &apos;s long life and small family , and third world is short life and large family . &quot;
they move up into that corner .
and this is lat@@ in america . it has everything on this earth , from the poor@@ est to the rich@@ est in lat@@ in america .
i can spl@@ it south asia here . india &apos;s the big bubble in the middle .
you have to train health staff . you have to educ@@ ate the population .
and this won &apos;t work . so what is needed ? we have the datab@@ ases .
this is the income distribution of china , 19@@ 70 . this is the income distribution of the united states , 19@@ 70 .
it &apos;s wonderful to be back .
because what i &apos;ve been doing for the last four years -- really since the first time you saw me -- some of you saw me at ted when i was talking about religion -- and in the last four years , i &apos;ve been working just about non-@@ stop on this topic .
mis@@ in@@ formed con@@ sent is not worth it .
that &apos;s the ste@@ ward .
evolution is cle@@ ver@@ er than you are .
9@@ 8 percent .
true story .
is it a good goal ? in itself , i &apos;m sure we all agree , it is a wonderful goal .
with me , everybody -- every time you read it or say it , you make another copy in your brain .
and then i find this : &quot; all the evidence available in the biological sci@@ ences suppor@@ ts the core pro@@ position that the cos@@ mos is a specially designed whole with life and man@@ kind as its fundamental goal and purpose , a whole in which all fac@@ ets of reality have their meaning and explan@@ ation in this central fact . &quot;
whose truth are we going to listen to ?
here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current break@@ down of the different religi@@ ons .
you got in it and you did it so often that it became real .
i &apos;m also looking to see what is shap@@ ing the person &apos;s ability to contribu@@ te , to do something beyond themselves . maybe the real question is ,
when you ask people , have you failed to achieve something significant in your life ?
they tell us we don &apos;t have the resources , but ultimately ,
you &apos;ve got it in your brain ; you &apos;ve got it in your lun@@ gs .
everyone needs certain@@ ty they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable . now , how do you get it ?
here &apos;s what we really need : connection and love , fourth need . we all want it ;
and somebody came to the door and deliver@@ ed food .
and they &apos;re a fire@@ man , and somebody else says , &quot; i &apos;m going to kill people to do it . &quot;
for a program i was conduc@@ ting , for a week .
and i said , &quot; what are we going to focus on ?
when you have 21 minutes to speak , two million years seems like a really long time .
interest@@ ingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
as a challenge to myself , since i say this once in a while in lectures , i took a copy of the new york times and tried to find some in@@ stances of people synthe@@ si@@ zing happiness . here are three guys synthe@@ si@@ zing happiness .
he wouldn &apos;t l@@ end him the money , and of course , six months later ray kro@@ c had exactly the same idea .
you bring in , say , six objects , and you ask a subject to r@@ ank them from the most to the least liked .
i &apos;ll take number three . &quot;
this capacity to synthe@@ size happiness , but some of us do this trick better than others .
so we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite profess@@ ors and their dor@@ m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memor@@ ies of .
w@@ ron@@ g-@@ o . bad simul@@ ators . because here &apos;s what &apos;s really happening .
but when those pre@@ fer@@ ences drive us too hard and too fast because we have over@@ r@@ ated the difference between these fu@@ tures , we are at risk .
the biolo@@ gist le@@ w@@ is wol@@ per@@ t belie@@ ves that the qu@@ eer@@ ness of modern physics is just an extreme example . science , as op@@ posed to technology , does violence to common sense .
as fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing as the pros@@ pe@@ ct was , he was going into the next office .
steve grand points out that you and i are , ourselves , more like a wave than a permanent thing .
j@@ .@@ b@@ .@@ s. hal@@ dan@@ e himself had something to say about animals whose world is domin@@ ated by smell .
if life has ar@@ isen only once on any -- life could origin@@ ate once per planet , could be extremely common or it could origin@@ ate once per star or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe , in which case it would have to be here . and somewhere up there would be the chance that a fro@@ g would turn into a prin@@ ce , and similar ma@@ gical things like that .
to suppose only what we needed to suppose in order to survive in the ple@@ ist@@ o@@ cen@@ e of africa ?
and i went to the it guys here
when i go to a philos@@ op@@ her &apos;s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t gla@@ ze over -- their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a sn@@ ar@@ l .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
if you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tric@@ ks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
people &apos;s memor@@ ies inf@@ late what they think they saw .
here &apos;s a completely different effect . this is a painting by bel@@ lo@@ t@@ to .
you think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there .
it &apos;s a nec@@ ker cu@@ be .
and this will just continue , and your job as the subject is to press the bu@@ tton when you see the change .
how many eng@@ ines on the wing of that boe@@ ing ?
that &apos;s my only real a@@ im in life .
so i get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profes@@ sion , etc . , etc . however , that &apos;s just , you know , the ini@@ tial idea i may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to inter@@ pr@@ et , but actually it &apos;s so un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably sh@@ allow .
that of a difference . then gradu@@ ally ... and gradu@@ ally ...
if there were no res@@ on@@ ators on here , we would have ... so he would have a ful@@ l@@ ness of sound that those of you in the front few ro@@ ws wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few ro@@ ws wouldn &apos;t experience either .
or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blin@@ dness is about .
see , you &apos;re a@@ wake .
like that . and then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
but i hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progre@@ sses .
hen@@ ry james would be proud .
so if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design hu@@ mil@@ ity , reflec@@ t on this -- it took us 5,000 years to put whe@@ els on our lu@@ g@@ ga@@ ge .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone age didn &apos;t end because we ran out of st@@ ones . &quot;
when i went to y@@ ale , we had the first energy crisis ,
we &apos;re ad@@ ding the j@@ eff@@ er@@ son@@ ian agenda , and i come from char@@ lo@@ t@@ te@@ s@@ ville , where i &apos;ve had the privilege of living in a house designed by thomas j@@ eff@@ er@@ son .
the biological one i &apos;m sure you understand , but also the technical one , where we take materials and put them into closed cy@@ cles .
that makes more energy than it needs to oper@@ ate and pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es its own water . here &apos;s a building for the gap , where the ancient gra@@ sses of san brun@@ o , california , are on the roof .
this is their plan .
we &apos;ve lif@@ ted the earth up onto the roo@@ fs .
i don &apos;t have to re@@ mind you of all the hy@@ pe that was involved with the internet -- like ge@@ tri@@ ch@@ .com .
and you saw some of the ex@@ cess@@ es that the do@@ t@@ c@@ om fe@@ ver created and the same thing happened .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bow@@ l to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in an@@ nu@@ al re@@ venue .
and this was huge . the first one was the electric fan -- this was the 18@@ 90 electric fan .
so this was -- remember , they didn &apos;t wire the houses for electricity .
this is what it looks like under my des@@ k .
199@@ 8 : &quot; ama@@ zon@@ .@@ to@@ ast@@ . &quot; in 199@@ 9 : &quot; ama@@ zon@@ .@@ bom@@ b@@ . &quot; my mom h@@ ates this picture .
i &apos;ll get the nit@@ wit on the network news saying , &quot; we &apos;ll be back in a moment with more on the crisis . &quot;
it &apos;s a very strange world inside a nano@@ tube .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : sing@@ er / son@@ g@@ writer ed@@ di rea@@ der perfor@@ ms &quot; what you do with what you &apos;ve got , &quot; a medi@@ tation on a very ted theme : how to use your gif@@ ts and tal@@ ents to make a difference . with thomas dol@@ by on piano .
♫ do you remember when we used to go ♫ ♫ up to kit@@ ef@@ l@@ yer &apos;s hill ? ♫ ♫ those summer ni@@ ghts , so still ♫ ♫ with all of the city bene@@ ath us ♫ ♫ and all of our lives ahead ♫ ♫ before cru@@ el and foo@@ lish words ♫ ♫ were cru@@ el@@ ly and foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ly said ♫ ♫ some ni@@ ghts i think of you ♫ ♫ and then i go up ♫ ♫ on kit@@ ef@@ l@@ yer &apos;s hill ♫
explor@@ ing the femin@@ ine , nur@@ turing side of di@@ vin@@ ity .
and if this is true , it must also be that god knows the joy and ex@@ al@@ tation of the human spirit , as well .
so the first big question is about control .
such a god would be mor@@ ally inf@@ eri@@ or to the highest ide@@ als of humanity .
the people knew their god by his mi@@ gh@@ ty acts .
to have faith in this god would be more like tru@@ sting an essential bene@@ vol@@ ence in the universe , and less like belie@@ ving a system of do@@ c@@ tr@@ in@@ al stat@@ e@@ ments .
thank you .
it &apos;s just cre@@ ation@@ ism under another name ,
the standard cre@@ ation@@ ist argument -- there is only one ; they &apos;re all reduc@@ ed to this one -- takes off from a statist@@ ical im@@ prob@@ ability .
&quot; everybody gets absolutely fran@@ tic about it , because you &apos;re not allowed to say these things . yet when you look at it ra@@ tionally , there &apos;s no reason why those ideas shouldn &apos;t be as open to debate as any other , except that we &apos;ve agre@@ ed somehow between us that they shouldn &apos;t be . &quot; and that &apos;s the end of the quote from dou@@ glas .
in practice , what is an athe@@ ist ?
and i know that there are -- if i could put a little plu@@ g here -- there are people in this audience easily capable of fin@@ an@@ cing a massive research survey to sett@@ le the question , and i put the suggesti@@ on up , for what it &apos;s worth .
when a critical mass has been ob@@ ta@@ ined , there &apos;s an ab@@ ru@@ pt acceler@@ ation in rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment .
you would stri@@ c@@ tly have to be ag@@ no@@ stic about whether there is a te@@ ap@@ ot in or@@ bit about mars , but that doesn &apos;t mean you treat the likel@@ i@@ hood of its existence as on all f@@ ours with its non-@@ existence .
but if we did achieve it with that dre@@ ad word &quot; athe@@ ist &quot; itself , the political impact would be even greater .

what is this ant doing ? what is this in aid of ?
these are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
the idea of replic@@ ating ideas ; ideas that replic@@ ate by passing from brain to brain .
sometimes when people say , &quot; do me@@ mes exist ? &quot;
i &apos;m just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implic@@ ations of the me@@ me@@ tic perspective , which i re@@ com@@ mend .
one of the things that we are doing is we &apos;re the ve@@ ctors of me@@ mes that are correc@@ tly vie@@ wed by the ho@@ sts of many other me@@ mes as a di@@ re threat to their favorite me@@ mes -- the me@@ mes that they are prepared to die for .

and they &apos;re la@@ bel@@ ed by color right now , by language .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
in fact , many of the organizations that are here -- the ac@@ u@@ men fund , i think ap@@ prote@@ c we have running , i &apos;m not sure if that one &apos;s up yet --
and these are all of his friends .
and so he started clu@@ ster@@ ing it by categ@@ ory ,
raise your hands .
and they don &apos;t always do their laun@@ dry as much as they should .
and the nice thing about this , we have a self-@@ serve program ,
so , &quot; related search@@ es , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this fe@@ ature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &quot; related search@@ es . &quot;
we accept pay@@ ment for adver@@ ti@@ sing , and we mark it as such .

this is a body of knowledge , method , sk@@ ill and principle that we thre@@ w in the gar@@ bage after world war ii and decided we don &apos;t need that anymore ; we &apos;re not going to use it .
it has something that is terri@@ bly important -- it has what &apos;s called an active and per@@ me@@ able me@@ m@@ bran@@ e around the edge .
and they shou@@ ted at me and said , &quot; it was ra@@ ining that day when you took that picture ! &quot;
so the first thing they do is they pop up the re@@ tail a half a story above grade to make it spor@@ ty .
and that &apos;s the great non-@@ artic@@ ul@@ ated ag@@ ony of sub@@ ur@@ bia and one of the reasons that it l@@ ends itself to ridi@@ cu@@ le .
chris asked me not to go on too long about this , and i won &apos;t ,
and we &apos;re going to fix them by im@@ pos@@ ing back on them street and block systems and re@@ turning to the building lot as the normal incre@@ ment of development .
&lt; / doc &gt;
so , we really will continue to focus on products .
we can put that up on a touch screen and you can play with that , and get more information about the clo@@ thing that you &apos;re interested in as you &apos;re trying it on .
the next video is not done by us .
so this building actually celebr@@ ates the water as it comes out of the recyc@@ ling plant and goes into the reed bed so that it can be fil@@ tered for the final time .
( nar@@ r@@ ator : and this central box connec@@ ts the whole system together .
and in my own practice , from product to ap@@ prote@@ c , it &apos;s really exciting that we &apos;re taking a more human@@ -@@ cen@@ tered approach to design , that we &apos;re including behaviors and person@@ alities in the things we do ,
education is the main event that can happen in cities .
and i &apos;ll try to do all that in 20 minutes . i have two af@@ fi@@ li@@ ations .
this is a quote from that article . he said , &quot; what is con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously lac@@ king , &quot; he &apos;s a very pro@@ per british gentle@@ man so , &quot; what is con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ously lac@@ king is a bro@@ ad frame@@ work of ideas in which to inter@@ pr@@ et these different approach@@ es . &quot;
so why should we have a good brain theory ?
there were 28@@ ,000 people who went to the neurosci@@ ence conference this year , and every one of them is doing research in brains .
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
do you feel like you &apos;re moving a thousand miles an hour ?
and the al@@ lig@@ ator has some very sophisticated sen@@ ses .
and if you &apos;re a rat and you go through a ma@@ ze , and then you learn the ma@@ ze ,
you &apos;re constantly making predic@@ tions about your environment .
anyone who gets up and tells you their theory about how the brain works and doesn &apos;t tell you exactly how it &apos;s working in the brain and how the wi@@ ring works in the brain , it is not a theory .
so you &apos;re not going to see c@@ -@@ 3@@ p@@ o .
and it &apos;s a li@@ vely and a lo@@ vely place , but we &apos;re rapidly changing the oceans with our -- not only with our over@@ fishing , our ir@@ responsible fishing , our ad@@ ding of pollu@@ tan@@ ts like fer@@ tili@@ zer from our cro@@ pl@@ and , but also , most recently , with climate change ,
the mol@@ a &apos;s no excep@@ tion .
and in the medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an , in the s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish net f@@ ish@@ eri@@ es , they make up up to 90 percent .
not this time of year -- it &apos;s more around oc@@ tober .
so the har@@ dest part of ta@@ gging , now , is after you put that tag on , you have to wait , months .
this is part of a much larger program called the cen@@ sus of marine life , where they &apos;re going to be ta@@ gging all over the world and the mol@@ a &apos;s going to enter into that .
and sometimes i &apos;m puzz@@ led , and i ask myself why .
the results are showing : independent monit@@ or@@ ing by the world bank and other organizations show that in many in@@ stances the trend is down@@ wards in terms of corruption , and govern@@ ance is impro@@ ving .
not the international mon@@ et@@ ary fund . not the world bank , where i worked for 21 years and r@@ ose to be a vice president .
so what did we try to do ? we introduced a fis@@ cal rule that de-@@ lin@@ ked our budget from the oil price .
and it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars .
but imagine the impact on a family : if the parents can be emplo@@ yed and make sure that their children go to school , that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves .
so i inv@@ ite you to explore the opportunities .
we went to brazil . we went to china and to india , to ben@@ ton@@ ville , ar@@ kans@@ as , to washington , d@@ .c@@ . and to sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to .
so , let me tell you this : when wal@@ -@@ mar@@ t achie@@ ves 20 percent energy reduc@@ tions , that &apos;s going to be a very big deal . but i &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not enough .
i &apos;ve got a beh@@ in@@ d-@@ the-@@ scen@@ es story for you about that green tech network i described .
compare that to the u.s. : five percent are fle@@ x-@@ fuel .
so , if all goes well , they &apos;re going to have designer bu@@ gs in warm v@@ ats that are eating and di@@ ge@@ sting su@@ g@@ ars to ex@@ crete better bio@@ fu@@ els .
not enough to keep the ice in green@@ land from cra@@ shing into the ocean .
can you imagine what it would be like if amazon or e@@ bay or google or microsoft or apple really went green and you caused that to happen ?
but the young people all came .
but if you were sitting on a park ben@@ ch and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d fre@@ ak out .
and we feel ourselves differently . it &apos;s totally strange .
you have to find some vision where you see how hop@@ eful it is , how it can be changed .
&lt; speaker &gt; an@@ and ag@@ ara@@ wal@@ a &lt; / speaker &gt;
also some of the stuff we can do is , for these individual ic@@ ons we thought -- i mean , how can we play with the idea of an ic@@ on , and push that further ?
i can tos@@ s these things around . they &apos;re so much more tan@@ gi@@ ble and tou@@ ch@@ able --
we need cooper@@ ation between you and the computing network and the computer .
the poor p@@ c guy . they &apos;re duc@@ t tap@@ ing his head . they &apos;re just wr@@ apping it on him .
an or@@ tho@@ -@@ view , a na@@ dir@@ -@@ view . how do you keep the preci@@ sion of the fi@@ del@@ ity of the ima@@ gery while main@@ ta@@ ining the f@@ lui@@ di@@ ty of the model ?
because of that , we still have the old mind@@ set of developing in industri@@ alized countries , which is wrong .
will it be possible that this will happen ?
and the bu@@ bb@@ les keep moving up there , and this is what the world looks like today .
and we go back to 19@@ 20 , and i want to look at japan .
swe@@ den was like ghana .
and in the discussion i atten@@ ded with global leaders , you know , many say now the problem is that the emerging econom@@ ies ,
and here it &apos;s a much ni@@ cer be@@ droom , you can see .
the women told us one thing . &quot; get us technology .
i only know two types of wine -- red and white .
environment is important .
s@@ word s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wing is from ancient india .
in case you &apos;re wondering , this is our strength test .
and when you used to find these things , they would put a la@@ bel on a map that said ter@@ min@@ al si@@ ph@@ on .
now we have to get through the ice .
we either draw in a liqu@@ id sample , or we can actually take a so@@ lid core from the wall .
if it exist@@ ed , it would change all future spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft design and space mission planning .
bob bi@@ gel@@ o@@ w currently has a test article in the or@@ bit .
to bu@@ st the paradig@@ m a radic@@ ally different approach is needed .
and what i want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating disease , why it &apos;s important ,
i &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
and about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spi@@ ke .
i would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the fore@@ see@@ able future -- we will talk about re@@ gener@@ ative re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation .
if we can invent materials , design materials , or extr@@ act materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials indu@@ ce the body to he@@ al itself .
if the horse was in pain , i wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
again , if you &apos;re s@@ que@@ am@@ ish , you don &apos;t want to watch .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
it &apos;s very powerful work .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and the first thing that i want to talk about , the first thing i think we need to understand is : how do people respond to the epidemic ?
i think it &apos;s possible , if we think about that intui@@ tion , and think about that fact , that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change .
so we &apos;re going to need to think about policy and what kind of poli@@ cies might be effective .
not a lot of other diseases have that pro@@ file . and you can see here -- this is a graph of death rates by age in bo@@ ts@@ wan@@ a and eg@@ ypt .
but open@@ ness and inter@@ -@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness , it comes with a cost when we think about disease . i don &apos;t think this should be a surprise .
and then actually they track each other a little bit on the increase later in the decade .
i think people are very similar , but i also think that we have trouble seeing that .
and they s@@ warm wil@@ dly around , kind of explor@@ ing the world of life .
we can do an age break@@ down , which gives us a hi@@ sto@@ gram of the world &apos;s emotional distribution by age .
&quot; i love how i feel today . &quot;
and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky .
and we see here a photograph with a head .
we can see the stories that bill clin@@ ton is taking part in right now .
so it &apos;s been a pleasure . thank you very much .
and they for@@ age maybe for about 20 meters away ,
she fe@@ eds the lar@@ va@@ e by reg@@ ur@@ g@@ it@@ ating from her fat reser@@ ves .
when it ra@@ ins in the summer , it f@@ loo@@ ds in the desert .
the queen &apos;s in there somewhere ; she just la@@ ys eg@@ gs .
does it matter to the for@@ agers what the nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers are doing ?
they become for@@ agers .
and it would change as the col@@ ony gets larger .
but the idea is that the ants are in there , and each ant is experi@@ encing a certain flow of ants past it -- a stream of cont@@ acts with other ants .
thank you .
and i had a tele@@ phone call from robert lu@@ e at harvard , in the molecular and cel@@ lu@@ lar biology department , a couple of years ago . he asked me if my team and i would be interested and willing to really change how medical and scientific education is done at harvard .
and each of us has about 100,000 of these things running around , right now , inside each one of your 100 trillion cells .
and this is a song me@@ d@@ ley i put together --
an awful lot of bad press --
it works a little something like -- this is a recent google search
co@@ inci@@ dence ? no , it &apos;s cre@@ ep@@ y .
i know a co@@ ded message when i see one .
we might not ever know .
al@@ li@@ son hun@@ t : my three minutes hasn &apos;t started yet , has it ?
and i got a good look at them . and you know , even i could tell my hip was bad ,
and i saw a sign .
which actually leads me to the biggest ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of them all .
now , there are a lot of afri@@ c@@ ans who are very an@@ gry , an@@ gry at the condition of africa .
every year africa sp@@ ends 20 billion dollars to im@@ port food .
the second fal@@ se pre@@ mise that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that car@@ es about its people , ser@@ ves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
now the modern sector , of course , is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into .
it is a total far c@@ ry .
that is not the kind of system afri@@ c@@ ans had known for centu@@ ries .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
you know , we &apos;ve built up reser@@ ves . why is that important ?
the econom@@ ies were not growing .
the issue is how are we using what has been given back .
i walked 10 kilometers , putting one foot in front of the other .
these are people who are productive agen@@ ts in the economy .
and one day , these found@@ ations have so much money , they will over@@ take the offici@@ al aid that is being given .
as a continent , here are our pri@@ orities .
if you tell them , &quot; we need a road here , &quot; they will help you build it .

the truth is , everything we know about america , everything americans come to know about being american , isn &apos;t from the news .

in fact , every time i read in i@@ rel@@ and , people get me all mista@@ ken and they say , &quot; oh , this is chris o &apos;@@ bar@@ ney from cor@@ k . &quot;
now for those of you who have seen me at the buff@@ et tab@@ les know that it was because it was co@@ sting them too much to feed me .
i really don &apos;t care anymore .

i think the market can help us figure that out , but there &apos;s got to be a char@@ it@@ able component , or i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to create the kind of societies we want to live in .

during the tw@@ en@@ tie@@ th century , we wit@@ ne@@ ssed the at@@ ro@@ cities of stal@@ in , hit@@ ler , ma@@ o , po@@ l pot , rwanda and other genoci@@ des , and even though the tw@@ en@@ ty-@@ first century is only seven years old , we have already wit@@ ne@@ ssed an on@@ going genocide in dar@@ f@@ ur and the daily hor@@ r@@ ors of iraq .

now , each one of them is thinking , &quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
because we have been doing something right , and it sure would be good to find out what it is .
and this is visible in the un@@ stop@@ p@@ able change in language -- the fact that by the time the acade@@ my fin@@ ish@@ es their dic@@ tionary , it will already be well out of date .
unfortunately , there appear to be idi@@ osy@@ n@@ cra@@ tic excep@@ tions .
these are re@@ min@@ is@@ cent of the kinds of categ@@ ories that im@@ manu@@ el kant argu@@ ed are the basic frame@@ work for human thought ,
and see human intelligence itself as consi@@ sting of a re@@ per@@ to@@ ire of concep@@ ts -- such as objects , space , time , cau@@ s@@ ation and inten@@ tion -- which are useful in a social , knowle@@ d@@ ge-@@ inten@@ sive species , whose evolution you can well imagine ,
in which relationships can be categ@@ ori@@ zed , more or less , into comm@@ un@@ ality , which works on the principle &quot; what &apos;s mine is th@@ ine , what &apos;s th@@ ine is mine , &quot;

so in these two examples , we had basically machines that learned how to walk in simu@@ lation , and also machines that learned how to walk in reality .
so of course , this is a very cru@@ de machine , but we &apos;re working on a micro-@@ scale version of these , and hopefully the cu@@ bes will be like a po@@ w@@ der that you p@@ our in .
which leads me to a vide@@ o@@ tape of a president bush press conference from a couple of weeks ago .

if we want humanity to last forever , we have to colon@@ ize the mil@@ ky way .
there &apos;s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the geor@@ ges bank , or the grand ban@@ ks off of new@@ found@@ land . it &apos;s a no@@ -@@ take fishing zone .
and in my opini@@ on , we don &apos;t spend enough time looking at that natural laboratory and fig@@ uring out first what &apos;s safe to do on earth .
so , there &apos;s a fairly simple solution to this .
that go@@ bble up the i@@ ron oxide on the surface of mars and sp@@ it out the oxygen .
we have a real , major out@@ break of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .

one is to continue to see a poor , ill , cr@@ ying africa , carrying gun@@ s , that depends on other people forever , or to promo@@ te an africa which is confi@@ dent , peac@@ eful , independent , but cogni@@ z@@ ant of its huge problems and great values at the same time .
and , in fact , some advan@@ ta@@ ges to ow@@ ning your own media company .
i then had a bit of a wa@@ ke@@ -up call when i was 14 .

and there really wasn &apos;t a specific company that was focused on the public interest .
at that point , i thought i knew something about global warming .
in clos@@ ing , i &apos;d like to say that everybody has the opportunity to make change in their own way .
not sure of all the details , but excited .

so , i turned on the tv , and i don &apos;t watch tv very much , but you know this person ? this is par@@ is hil@@ ton , appar@@ ently .

wasn &apos;t she amazing ? mu@@ ri@@ el coo@@ per . she was wa@@ cky .
very good , us humans ! we &apos;re cat@@ ching up with the computers .
she has this show right now at mom@@ a , where some of these early works are here on disp@@ lay at mom@@ a , on the walls .
so i focused on food as my area -- in japan , it &apos;s a wonderful thing to re@@ move the cle@@ ment@@ ine pe@@ el just in one piece . who &apos;s done that before ? one-@@ piece cle@@ ment@@ ine ?
so , i thought , maybe i &apos;ll do this for the next tw@@ enty years or something .
i love life . i love being alive . i like to see things .
this whole ted effect , it sort of u@@ ps your wisdom , somehow .
and interest@@ ingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ men@@ tal@@ ists .
in other words , as i might se@@ ek to demonstr@@ ate , if you could achieve the impossible , the equivalent of per@@ pe@@ tual motion , you could design a car@@ bon@@ -@@ free house , for example .
and that ur@@ ban@@ i@@ zation is extraordinary , acceler@@ ated p@@ ace .
it anti@@ cip@@ ated change , even though those changes were not known .
if i made the lea@@ p into these new technologies , then how did we -- what happened before that ?
so it would be totally renewa@@ ble .
we can see the high pressure , the low pressure , the way in which the building beha@@ ves rather like an air@@ craft wing .
250 -- ex@@ cu@@ se me , 50,000 people working 24 hours , seven days .
in order to do that in 20 minutes , i have to bring out four ideas -- it &apos;s like four pieces of a puzzle .
it did not cor@@ rel@@ ate with the size of class@@ rooms .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough b@@ ind , you have to think .
so it was a warm day , and the hole in the wall was on that de@@ cre@@ p@@ it old building . this is the first kid who came there ;
you know , how on earth did they know all this ?
and this happens very often with these computers , that the youn@@ ger children are found teaching the older ones .
it seems counter@@ -@@ intui@@ tive to adult learning , but remember , ei@@ ght-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds live in a society where most of the time they are told , don &apos;t do this , you know , don &apos;t touch the wh@@ is@@ key bottle .
but at this point in time , as far as science goes , it &apos;s self-@@ organization .
&lt; / doc &gt;
but then , got off on a vac@@ ation trip , and was studying bird flight ,
but while this was going on , in 198@@ 2 , i got a prize from the lin@@ d@@ ber@@ gh foundation -- their an@@ nu@@ al prize -- and i had to pre@@ p@@ are a paper on it , which collec@@ ted all my vari@@ ed thoughts
what &apos;s the population of the earth ?
paul mac@@ cre@@ ad@@ y : the wings could touch together on top and not break . we think .
i &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
lar@@ ry brilliant : the case for optimis@@ m
it will cause ri@@ sing se@@ as . it will cause sal@@ ine de@@ pos@@ ited into wel@@ ls and into lands .
last year , there were 8@@ 5,000 ri@@ o@@ ts in china , 2@@ 30 a day , that required police or military interven@@ tion .
a minim@@ um of 20 to 40 in@@ ches of increase in se@@ as , cou@@ ple@@ d with increasing flo@@ ws from the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as . and take a look at this .
20 years ago , there were three and a half million .
now , that doesn &apos;t mean that people understand that global warming hur@@ ts the poor@@ est and the wea@@ ke@@ st the most .
how can that not make you optimi@@ stic ?
in fact , just studying the r@@ ings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the disc@@ s of stars and gas that we call the spir@@ al galaxies .
it &apos;s a con@@ den@@ s@@ able in the atmosphere , and so recogni@@ zing this circum@@ stance brought to the fore a whole world of biz@@ ar@@ re possibilities . you can have me@@ than@@ e clou@@ ds , ok , and above those clou@@ ds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of ha@@ ze , which prevent any sun@@ light from getting to the surface .
and so it &apos;s been te@@ ct@@ on@@ ically al@@ tered .
was this a shor@@ el@@ ine of flu@@ ids ? we didn &apos;t know .
so it seems that the li@@ qui@@ ds , for some reason we don &apos;t understand , or during at least this seas@@ on , are appar@@ ently at the po@@ les of tit@@ an .
and if any of you were al@@ ert and co@@ her@@ ent during the 196@@ 0s -- and we &apos;d for@@ give you , if you weren &apos;t , ok -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apol@@ lo 8 astron@@ au@@ ts in 196@@ 8 .
richard br@@ ans@@ on : thank you very much . the first ted has been great .
and so , you know , so got one secon@@ d@@ hand 7@@ 47 from boe@@ ing and gave it a go .
and i think that industri@@ es are not quite the same as a result of vir@@ g@@ in attac@@ king the market .
what was that ? was that real ?
ca : well , god saved her and you got your just re@@ ward .
rb : he &apos;s a wonderful en@@ thu@@ si@@ ast , which is why i love him . but ...
rb : well , i knew i had about half an hour &apos;s fuel left , and i also knew that the chan@@ ces were that if i jump@@ ed , i would only have a couple of minutes of life left .
rb : well , i won &apos;t contra@@ dic@@ t that .
did this really happen ?
and then sub@@ sequ@@ ently , &quot; never mind the bol@@ loc@@ ks , here &apos;s the sex p@@ ist@@ ol@@ s , &quot;
and i like to think that &apos;s how we run vir@@ g@@ in .
so , for instance , there &apos;s a doctor in africa that &apos;s found that if you give a mother anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al drugs at 24 weeks , when she &apos;s pre@@ gn@@ ant , that the baby will not have hiv when it &apos;s born .
you &apos;re still doing these incredible new pl@@ ans .
i &apos;m trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period .
that -- fortunately , there were enough people there , and it was a team , it was a collective , it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas .
so , i get to put in all of the things that i love .
you know , in the course of my life , i never know what &apos;s going to happen and that &apos;s kind of the beauty part .
and it was a phenomen@@ ally wonderful event , which we hopefully will do some more .
and then i want to tell you that this is a map .
or are they fa@@ ke senten@@ ces that we think we ought to be saying ?
and i went to visit lou@@ ise b@@ our@@ geo@@ ise , who &apos;s also still working , and i looked at her sin@@ k , which is really amazing , and left .
how many of you know what i &apos;m talking about ?
so you get 250 of these in the mail in little tu@@ bes .
i mean , you have 100 billion ner@@ ve cells , little wi@@ sp@@ s of pro@@ top@@ la@@ sm , interac@@ ting with each other ,
and in@@ hi@@ bits these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges towards your mother .
which you can completely ignor@@ e .
tab@@ les and cha@@ irs and lin@@ t , nothing happens , as in normal people ,
it &apos;ll p@@ at his brother on the shoul@@ der , it &apos;ll answer the phone when it r@@ ings , it &apos;ll wave goo@@ d@@ b@@ ye .
well , we said , what if you now send the com@@ mand to the ph@@ an@@ tom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s obe@@ ying his com@@ mand , right ?
i said , &quot; move your normal hand . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , last three days , i &apos;ve not had a ph@@ an@@ tom arm and therefore no ph@@ an@@ tom el@@ bo@@ w pain , no cl@@ en@@ ching , no ph@@ an@@ tom for@@ ear@@ m pain , all those pa@@ ins are gone away .
c shar@@ p is blue , f shar@@ p is green ,
so , every brain region is wired to every other region ,
in your audi@@ tory cortex , the hair cells being excited -- ki@@ ki ,
which is to measure their gr@@ os@@ s national happiness rather than their gr@@ os@@ s national product .
another no@@ table econom@@ ist , the@@ od@@ ore schul@@ tz , in 197@@ 4 won the no@@ bel prize for demonstr@@ ating that farmers are efficient , but poor .
and i thought that was incredibly pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar .
africa today is not the africa waiting for aid solutions , or coo@@ kie@@ -@@ cu@@ tter foreign expert policy pre@@ scrip@@ tions .
and we &apos;re seeing a shift -- powered main@@ ly because of information technology -- a shift in market domin@@ ance towards the emerging markets .
meaning that he or she would go to the ne@@ ar@@ est local market , eight to 10 kilometers away on average , and sell whatever they happened to have , without any idea of what the price pre@@ mi@@ um or anything else was --
so , we are in the business of finding our happiness .
s@@ ous@@ a &apos;s fear was that we would lose that capacity because of these , quote , &quot; inf@@ ern@@ al machines . &quot; they would take it away .
now , at that time , the en@@ tity , the legal car@@ tel , that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broad@@ cast using these technologies was as@@ ca@@ p .
this one you should be -- confidence . je@@ sus survi@@ ves . don &apos;t worry .
now , in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies , the law has not gre@@ e@@ ted this s@@ ous@@ a re@@ vi@@ val with very much common sense .
we don &apos;t have a public dom@@ ain to draw upon now , so instead what we need is two types of changes .
thank you very much .

i &apos;m telling you this story , because actually ever since richard called me and asked me to talk about -- as he asked all of his spea@@ kers -- to talk about something that would be new to this audience ,
that pro@@ ved to be a lot of bo@@ v@@ ine ster@@ cus .
it was impossible . so they decided there was no therapy , there was no treatment . but there was one treatment , which actually had been pion@@ eer@@ ed at the hart@@ ford hospital in the early 19@@ 40@@ s ,
that i was now strong enough that by an act of will , i could b@@ low the obse@@ ssi@@ on@@ al thinking away .
re@@ su@@ sc@@ it@@ ated the career , even better than it had been before .
acci@@ dents happen . something from childhood comes back to ha@@ unt you .
it &apos;s not in the lab ,
ok , that &apos;s fair enough .
i think , quite a nice fe@@ ature .
so , the u.@@ n. estim@@ ated -- this is 2004 figu@@ res -- that there are almost 800 million people who can &apos;t read and write , worldwide .
and even if they could have access to the ban@@ king infrastructure , they wouldn &apos;t necessarily be considered vi@@ able custom@@ ers , because they &apos;re not weal@@ thy enough to have bank accoun@@ ts .
and i know what you &apos;re asking -- did i test it ?
it &apos;s all about the dots jo@@ ining together .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chemi@@ st turned bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st mon@@ k mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u ri@@ card says we can train our minds in ha@@ bits of well-@@ being , to generate a true sense of ser@@ en@@ ity and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
as pas@@ cal said , even the one who han@@ gs himself , somehow , is looking for cess@@ ation of suffering . he fin@@ ds no other way .
and happiness , of course , is such a va@@ gue word , so let &apos;s say well-@@ being .
isn &apos;t it the mind that translat@@ es the ou@@ ter condition into happiness and suffering ?
is change possible in our emotions , in our tra@@ its , in our moo@@ ds ?
so what we need to look for now is , instead of looking ou@@ tw@@ ard , we look in@@ ward .
so what did they find ? of course , same thing .
it &apos;s more to say that mind training matters . that this is not just a lux@@ ury .
you &apos;ve all seen lots of artic@@ les on climate change ,
cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military , not the cost of medical care .
but you &apos;ll notice that in the up@@ per bar , which is the lower atmosphere and the surface , it c@@ ools down because we shi@@ el@@ ded the atmosphere a little bit .
the only thing they talked about doing was ge@@ o-@@ engineering .
there are a lot of fun complex@@ i@@ ties that i &apos;d love to spend the whole even@@ ing on , but i won &apos;t .
because we have no way to agree about where to set the kno@@ bs .
but here &apos;s a case which is harder to re@@ ject .
many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that .
so we &apos;ve been plan@@ ting stuff for 1@@ 1,000 years . and
agriculture over a century , agriculture in about 19@@ 00 would have been recogni@@ z@@ able to somebody plan@@ ting a thousand years earlier . yeah , the plo@@ ws look different . the machines were trac@@ tors or stuff instead of mu@@ les , but the farm@@ er would have understood : this is what the guy &apos;s doing , this is why he &apos;s doing it , this is where he &apos;s going . what
you &apos;re producing a bio@@ gas out of coal in some min@@ es , but not in others .
this is what accu@@ mul@@ ates in the tar s@@ ands of al@@ ber@@ ta . these are sul@@ f@@ ur blocks . because as you separate that pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um from the sand , and use an enormous amount of energy inside that v@@ ap@@ or -- ste@@ am to separate this stuff -- you also have to separate out the sul@@ f@@ ur . the difference between light cru@@ de and heavy cru@@ de -- well , it &apos;s about 14 bu@@ cks a bar@@ re@@ l . that &apos;s why you &apos;re building these py@@ rami@@ ds of sul@@ f@@ ur blocks . and by the way , the
we &apos;ll be talking about them .
i &apos;ll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer , and that is , it has nothing to do with human beings .
you &apos;ve heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway .
here &apos;s an example of this simil@@ ar@@ ity .
the next -- second -- equ@@ ation says that there is no magne@@ tis@@ m other than that .
that was a big uni@@ fic@@ ation for those days , although today we take it for gran@@ ted .
you don &apos;t need something more in order to get something more .
the problem is , there are many , many feet .
without a foot , here &apos;s what it does . it doesn &apos;t even slow down .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
they &apos;re tun@@ ed such that they easily collap@@ se in one direction to pull the leg out from de@@ br@@ is , but they &apos;re sti@@ ff in the other direction so they capture disp@@ ari@@ ties in the surface .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively cli@@ mb@@ s by sli@@ pping and look -- and doing , actually , terri@@ bly , with respect to gra@@ bb@@ ing on the surface .
this is when its foot &apos;s in the air .
and each hair has the worst case of spl@@ it ends possible .
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; robot in sc@@ ans@@ ori@@ al environment &quot; -- that &apos;s a cli@@ mb@@ ing environment --
and so they were able to get this thing -- this is now sp@@ ed up 20 times -- can you imagine it trying to go up and resc@@ ue somebody at that up@@ per floor ? ok ?
♫ i &apos;ll watch it ton@@ ight on my &apos; po@@ d ♫ ♫ and now all of the networks are jo@@ ining in ♫ ♫ two bu@@ cks a show without ads ♫ ♫ it &apos;s a business those guys always wanted to try ♫ ♫ but only steve jobs had the &apos; na@@ ds ♫ ♫ they say we &apos;re young , don &apos;t watch tv ♫ ♫ they say the internet is all we see ♫ ♫ but that &apos;s not true ; they &apos;ve got it wrong ♫
i don &apos;t try to design the too@@ th@@ bru@@ sh .
even , i think , we copy our way to re@@ produce , you know what i mean ,
the more you will rise , to see far and high , like that , the more you will be important for the story of our mu@@ tation .
you must go back to politics , you must go back to radic@@ alization , i &apos;m sorry if that &apos;s not very english .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
now , mathema@@ ti@@ cians thought this was very strange because as you sh@@ rin@@ k a r@@ ul@@ er down , you measure a longer and longer l@@ ength .
and it turns out the ro@@ y@@ al in@@ sig@@ nia has a rec@@ t@@ angle within a rec@@ t@@ angle within a rec@@ t@@ angle , and the path through that pal@@ ace is actually this spir@@ al here .
and i started to realize that the cy@@ cles of fer@@ til@@ ity were just like the rec@@ ur@@ sive cy@@ cles in the geome@@ tric algorith@@ m that buil@@ ds this .
and three times , the answer is no .
it &apos;s called man@@ cal@@ a here on the east coast , ba@@ o in kenya , so@@ go el@@ se@@ where .
and they did this very rapidly , and i couldn &apos;t understand where they were getting -- they only did the rand@@ om@@ ness four times -- i couldn &apos;t understand where they were getting the other 12 symb@@ ol@@ s .
in the 12@@ th century , hu@@ go of san@@ tal@@ la brought it from islam@@ ic my@@ stics into sp@@ ain .
i didn &apos;t put his name up here -- my collea@@ gue , ker@@ ry , in kenya , has come up with this great idea for using frac@@ tal structure for post@@ al address in villa@@ ges that have frac@@ tal structure ,

at any rate , at one point my bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , leon@@ ard , decided to write a book about a seri@@ al kill@@ er .
and it &apos;s well known by epide@@ mi@@ ologists that kids who live near tex@@ ti@@ le works tend to have high rates of leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a .
and so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
but too late .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : at ted u , ge@@ ver t@@ ul@@ ley , f@@ oun@@ der of the tin@@ ker@@ ing school , spel@@ ls out 5 dangerous things you should let your kids do -- and why a little danger is good for both kids and grow@@ nu@@ ps .
whether we remember it or not , it &apos;s the first time we really get control of one of these mysteri@@ ous things .
but when you exercise them , any given muscle ad@@ ds strength to the whole system , and that app@@ lies to your brain , too .
and that really gives them a hand@@ le on a world in a way that they don &apos;t often have access to .
and i think this picture inspired chris to in@@ ser@@ t me into the lat@@ er@@ al thinking se@@ ssion .
and this research is being pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ated by the u.s. government , so you can see that your ta@@ x man is working for good causes .
i &apos;m here to tell you a few tal@@ es of passion .
a spec@@ k of snow , an in@@ ch of ice , the force of the wind , can deter@@ mine the result of a race or a game .
sophi@@ a is over 70 and she looks great .
the pro@@ ta@@ gon@@ ists of this story are a young woman , r@@ ose m@@ ap@@ en@@ do , and her children .
they have no education and no freedom .
the woman &apos;s face looks like a water@@ mel@@ on .
what kind of world do we want ?
i want to make this world good .
ce@@ ph@@ al@@ op@@ o@@ ds -- head@@ -@@ foo@@ ts . as a kid i knew them as cal@@ am@@ ari , mostly .
but look at the patterns that they can do with their skin .
&lt; speaker &gt; pa@@ ol@@ a an@@ ton@@ el@@ li &lt; / speaker &gt;
the exhi@@ bi@@ tion was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ... you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
but design , for some reason , is still mis@@ understood for de@@ cor@@ ation .
there were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about poin@@ ting people in the direction of a better design for a better life .
i would like , instead , to talk about how great some designers are .
and the police is re@@ min@@ ded ; it &apos;s like having a flo@@ wer in front of the ri@@ f@@ le .
and this is a rain@@ co@@ at that is made out of ri@@ ce sac@@ ks .
i wanted to show you , for instance , the work of ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u le@@ han@@ ne@@ ur , which is quite fantastic .
but there it is : &quot; j@@ ó n@@ ap@@ ot , pac@@ á@@ k &quot;
he built one plant after another .
&quot; good . buy us some land in k@@ ings mountain and announ@@ ce we are going to build a major plant there . &quot;
to me , it was im@@ mensel@@ y reas@@ sur@@ ing that the presi@@ ding spirit of this little metho@@ di@@ st college in up@@ state south carolina was a h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st survi@@ vor from central europe .
it was he who broke the may@@ an co@@ dex , enab@@ ling schol@@ ars to rel@@ ate the pic@@ to@@ graph@@ s on may@@ an cer@@ am@@ ics to the hier@@ o@@ g@@ ly@@ ph@@ s of the may@@ an script .
&quot; learn as if you &apos;ll live forever . &quot;
kind of min@@ ding my own business . and there was this artist teaching ,
man@@ ch@@ ester cra@@ f@@ ts@@ men &apos;s gu@@ il@@ d is named after my neighborhood .
i said to my boy , &quot; when you raise the money , we &apos;ll put your taste on the wall . &quot;
that happens to be at christ@@ mas time .
that happens to be our caf@@ e@@ ter@@ ia line .
and we train chemical techni@@ cians for companies like ba@@ yer and cal@@ g@@ on carbon and fis@@ her scientific and ex@@ x@@ on .
for that i won a big old pla@@ que -- man of the year in education .
you have to t@@ one down the je@@ sus stuff a little bit , but keep the en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m .
and i said , &quot; you &apos;re in the computer business , is that right ? &quot;
all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park to sold out audi@@ ences in the middle of the inner city .
we are currently number four on the b@@ ill@@ board char@@ ts , right behind ton@@ y ben@@ net@@ t .
and we got the funding and we open in the fall .
and now i really want to build one . &quot;
i said , &quot; well , i met the guy who built the thing and he left me his card . &quot;
and qu@@ in@@ cy said , &quot; where did the idea for centers like this come from ? &quot;
you &apos;re always fighting up@@ stream like a sal@@ mon -- never enough money , too much need --
and i was intri@@ gu@@ ed by this sort of mass vo@@ y@@ eu@@ ris@@ m ,
so , the photograph becomes this te@@ as@@ er and in@@ c@@ ites desire and vo@@ y@@ eu@@ ris@@ m ;
suddenly i was becoming sort of accep@@ table , which i found also fascinating .
i was also making a tv series for the bb@@ c at the time .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir and ch@@ erie . and again , the leg@@ alities -- we had to be very car@@ eful .
ton@@ y bla@@ ir being used as a moun@@ ting block ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 2@@ 11 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die and 15 years work would have come for nothing .
ma@@ dame de ga@@ ul@@ le , the wife of the french president , was fam@@ ously asked once , &quot; what do you most desire ? &quot;
it &apos;s the total brain experience , we &apos;re going to ... it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body massa@@ ge .
and more important , i think , the ideas that are exhi@@ b@@ ited and realized here are ideas that the foundation can use , because there &apos;s fantastic sy@@ ner@@ gy .
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fu@@ el@@ -@@ efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
maybe i would have bought the ice cre@@ am when i did some other er@@ rand . &quot;
in london , the day they turned the con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on pri@@ cing on , there was a 25 percent de@@ cre@@ ase in con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on over@@ night , and that &apos;s per@@ si@@ sted for the four years in which they &apos;ve been doing con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on pri@@ cing .
and this is a moment from &quot; the graduate . &quot; do you remember this moment ?
there isn &apos;t anybody in washington lo@@ bb@@ ying to make it happen -- or in those muni@@ cip@@ alities , to build out their cities with these wirel@@ ess networks -- because there &apos;s zero on@@ going communic@@ ations cost .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
during many years , i made some spe@@ e@@ ches starting with this saying : &quot; city is not a problem , it &apos;s a solution . &quot;
o@@ ax@@ ac@@ a , san francisco -- it &apos;s very easy : market street , van ness and the water@@ front .
-- that &apos;s why when we &apos;re talking about sustain@@ ability , it &apos;s not enough , green buildings .
i would like to say , if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what &apos;s said , but don &apos;t forget the cities and the children .
and this is an ac@@ u@@ pun@@ c@@ ture note -- or i@@ .@@ m@@ . pe@@ i &apos;s . some small ones can make the city better .
and tell you about a tool , a very simple tool that i have found .
and i had sum@@ mon@@ ed those genes from a seed cat@@ alo@@ g across the country , brought it , and i was plan@@ ting it .
so i started looking at things this way
and that &apos;s another very important thing it does .
and the talk you heard about eth@@ an@@ ol earlier today , to me , is the final tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h of cor@@ n over good sense . it is part of cor@@ n &apos;s sche@@ me for world domin@@ ation .
co@@ ws gra@@ ze one day . they move , ok ?
well , look how much food you can produce on 100 ac@@ res if you do this kind of ... again , give each species what it wants ,
when we really begin to feel darwin &apos;s insi@@ ghts in our b@@ ones , the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas are something to be very hop@@ eful about .
not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home , driving into ris@@ d everyday , driving back .
here &apos;s a little map . and i thought of maps at the beginning ;
a nice way to show that river , that stream sort of p@@ our@@ ing down the hill .
so that sort of brings her little story to a conclu@@ sion .
he goes down to the base@@ ment and starts to check the wi@@ ring , and then gradu@@ ally works his way up to the top of the building , apart@@ ment by apart@@ ment , chec@@ king every television , chec@@ king every connection , hop@@ ing to find out what this problem is .
but more importantly , i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent buildings with all the massive stone blocks , or the fa@@ ke stone blocks done with bri@@ ck and stu@@ c@@ co , which is more often the case .
and that allows me to go through my cat@@ alo@@ g of favorite things ,
so , we circle around the co@@ li@@ se@@ um , past the church of san@@ ta mar@@ ia in cos@@ me@@ d@@ in and the temp@@ le of her@@ cu@@ les towards the river .
and if you want the information , so that we complete this cycle of understanding , all you have to do is read these para@@ graph@@ s .
although they must have solved some collective action problems ;
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the de@@ sk@@ tops ,
now , the fundamental basis of ne@@ o@@ cla@@ s@@ sical economics would tell you it &apos;s ir@@ rational to re@@ ject a dollar because someone you don &apos;t know in another room is going to get 99 .
which led one scientist to de@@ cl@@ are that al@@ tru@@ i@@ stic pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment may be the glu@@ e that hol@@ ds societies together .
that &apos;s fol@@ ding @ home at stanford --
thank you .
you can &apos;t open yourself to new experiences , new people , new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course .
ideas get shor@@ ter . they become sound by@@ tes .
they have broken out of the existing frame of vic@@ tim and per@@ pe@@ tr@@ ator .
they told her she couldn &apos;t love her vagina in high school , that it was not a legal thing , that it was not a moral thing , that it was not a good thing .
three years ago , ag@@ nes opened a safe house in africa to stop mu@@ ti@@ lation .
the end goal will &#91; be &#93; becoming vulnerable , reali@@ zing the place of our connection to one another , rather than becoming sec@@ ure , in control and alone .
well , what i &apos;m doing is control@@ ling the pit@@ ch with my left hand .
it really does reflec@@ t the m@@ ood that you &apos;re in also , if you &apos;re ... it &apos;s similar to being a vo@@ cali@@ st , except instead of it coming out of your thro@@ at ,
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that .
every wall , every concrete wall is resi@@ sting the stre@@ sses and suppor@@ ting the building .
and i went down and ch@@ ief minister bad@@ al said to me , &quot; we si@@ k@@ h@@ s have suff@@ ered a great deal , as you have je@@ ws .
i was ren@@ am@@ ed sa@@ f@@ die sing@@ h . and there it is under construction ;
the first s@@ ket@@ ch recogni@@ zes that the building is many spaces -- spaces where research goes on , conference centers , a public building because it will be a museum de@@ vo@@ ted to peac@@ e@@ making -- and these are the dra@@ wings that we sub@@ mit@@ ted for the competition , the pl@@ ans showing the spaces which radi@@ ate ou@@ tw@@ ards from the en@@ try .
thank you very much .
i got a schol@@ ar@@ ship to st@@ . la@@ wr@@ ence university , up@@ state new york ;
and it &apos;s a really poor area . i represent northern kenya : the most n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c , remote areas you can even find .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 22@@ 1 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture .
which meant that it was all secret .
they got quite serious about the engineering of this .
and one of the bad things that could happen to nasa is if that astero@@ id shows up with our name on it nine months out , and everybody says , &quot; well , what are we going to do ? &quot;
and little did i know that one year later ... ♫ we &apos;d be doing this show . ♫ ♫ so@@ bu@@ le : i sing . swe@@ en@@ ey : i tell stories . together : the j@@ ill and juli@@ a show . ♫ so@@ bu@@ le : hey , they asked us back ! swe@@ en@@ ey : can you stand it ? ! ♫ together : the j@@ ill and juli@@ a , the j@@ ill and juli@@ a , the j@@ ill and juli@@ a show . ♫ ♫ so@@ bu@@ le : why are all our heroes so im@@ perfect ? ♫
on a scientific basis , it &apos;s more than just &quot; power of positive thinking &quot; -- it has a horri@@ ble , horri@@ ble dark side . like if you get ill , it &apos;s because you &apos;ve just been thinking negative thoughts .
yeah , look at this . you know , all kinds of different ... ted is about invention , let &apos;s be honest . right ? dh : yeah , it is .
bf : you know , over the years , every year at the conference , it &apos;s kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous with richard . and we &apos;ve always done something with the bul@@ l@@ whi@@ ps in our act . it &apos;s funny , for years i did it with dan@@ iel holding bal@@ lo@@ ons .
ok .
dh : true . bar@@ ry ... bf : i &apos;m going to run up behind him .
bf : no , she &apos;s got ... farm animal .
dh : whenever you &apos;re ready .
bf : nice .
dh : we will ju@@ g@@ gle seven .
it &apos;s going to change the way we do astronom@@ y , it &apos;s going to change the way we teach astronom@@ y and i think most importantly it &apos;s going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe .
before i introduce the person responsible for the worldwide telescope , i just want to leave you with this brief thought :
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 2@@ 25 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and if we can run the video , i &apos;ll show you what it took to get this dre@@ am@@ works shot .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 22@@ 8 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest ep@@ i@@ stem@@ ological barri@@ ers in human history .
whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simu@@ lation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biolo@@ gist , i didn &apos;t like that at all .
so they had created these arti@@ facts .
and i get a little object here and i can look inside this object ,
they &apos;re even@@ ly spac@@ ed because they &apos;re 30 apart .
so what i &apos;m doing is meas@@ uring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fif@@ th of a second later , like that . and they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time ,
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface ,
because i was performing this type of research during the day , but then in the even@@ ings and on the wee@@ ken@@ ds , i travel@@ ed as an advoc@@ ate for nam@@ i , the national al@@ li@@ ance on mental illness .
our left he@@ mi@@ sphere thinks lin@@ early and metho@@ dic@@ ally .
and i &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and i realize that everything inside of my body has slo@@ wed way down .
and i felt this sense of peac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
in the mean@@ time , for 45 minutes , the he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ ge is getting bigger in my left he@@ mi@@ sphere .
but then i realized , &quot; but i &apos;m still alive ! i &apos;m still alive , and i have found ni@@ r@@ van@@ a .

there are actually ways of getting rid of them ,
so this slide is a fa@@ ke slide .
and yet you touch the p@@ ing-@@ p@@ ong ball very ligh@@ tly and it just sc@@ oo@@ ts across the screen .
now , that would be , if you will , the top green track , which doesn &apos;t mean too much . but you might have to el@@ abor@@ ate for me or for somebody who isn &apos;t an expert , and say , &quot; c@@ ook at 3@@ 80 degrees for 45 minutes . &quot;
re@@ pa@@ ir@@ man : ... not too far out . front po@@ les , pre@@ fer@@ ably .
and you obviously have been hoo@@ d@@ win@@ ked or you &apos;ve talked about somebody else . &quot;
on the other hand , you give a kid -- a three-@@ year-old kid -- a computer
and when somebody gets up , in fact , to go answer a phone or use a ba@@ th@@ room or something , the empty seat becomes , if you will , that person . and you point frequ@@ ently to the empty seat and you say , &quot; he or she wouldn &apos;t agree , &quot;
and , i get a lot of fla@@ k for this at cambridge .
and he wasn &apos;t doing that . he was scri@@ bb@@ ling with ch@@ al@@ k on the pa@@ vement .
and she &apos;s now in her 8@@ 0s .
and if they colli@@ de , it would look a lot like the big bang .
as i pur@@ su@@ ed my career , something was always g@@ na@@ wing away inside me .
my parents were both elec@@ ted to the first par@@ li@@ am@@ ent , al@@ on@@ g@@ side nelson and win@@ nie mand@@ ela . they were the only other couple .
and bright young afri@@ c@@ ans are desper@@ ate to join the global community , to be successful -- and they &apos;re very ambi@@ tious .
we illustr@@ ate a@@ ims &apos; progress by color@@ ing in the countries of africa .
so all in all i have a very good ph@@ .@@ d@@ . student from south africa .
our ted dream is that the next einstein will be african . in stri@@ ving for the he@@ i@@ ghts of creative geni@@ us , we want to give thousands of people the motiv@@ ation , the encoura@@ gement and the coura@@ ge to ob@@ tain the high-@@ level skills they need to help africa .
easy to remember the basic rules we need .
and so i was always hearing them talk about their lives and how inspir@@ ing they were , and they were really sort of the most har@@ d-@@ working and constantly inspir@@ ing people i knew .
so , we had this place , we ren@@ ted it , the land@@ lor@@ d was all for it . we did this m@@ ural , that &apos;s a chris ware m@@ ural , that basically explains the entire history of the prin@@ ted word , in m@@ ural form -- it takes a long time to di@@ gest and you have to stand in the middle of the road .
anyway , we bought &apos; em , we set everything up and then we wa@@ ited .
first of all , it was a p@@ ir@@ ate supply store , which is in@@ san@@ e .
then we said , &quot; well , what are we going to do with the space during the day ,
so then we &apos;re able to work with thousands and thousands of more students .
so we sell &apos; em , and then something weird had been happening with the stor@@ es . the store , actually -- even though we started out as just a ga@@ g -- the store actually made money .
these are all sort of re@@ pur@@ posed other products , or whatever .
this is one of the students , k@@ hal@@ ed ham@@ dan .
now i &apos;m going to the ted wish -- is that okay ?
students and parents need you . they need your actual person : your physical person@@ hood and your open minds and open e@@ ars and bound@@ less compassion , sitting next to them , listening and no@@ d@@ ding and asking questions for hours at a time .
i &apos;d seen ju@@ da@@ ism only as a kind of p@@ rel@@ u@@ de to chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , and i knew nothing about islam at all .
and it was -- the gol@@ den rule would bring them to the trans@@ cen@@ dent value that he called &quot; ren , &quot; human@@ -@@ he@@ ar@@ ted@@ ness , which was a trans@@ cen@@ dent experience in itself .
there &apos;s also a great deal , i think , of religious il@@ liter@@ acy around .
you know the story of &quot; the ili@@ ad , &quot; the 10@@ -@@ year war between gre@@ e@@ ce and tro@@ y .
the importance of this is that this is -- i can see some of you starting to look worried , because you think it &apos;s a slow and cu@@ mber@@ some body -- but what the united nations can do is give us some neutr@@ ality , so that this isn &apos;t seen as a western or a chri@@ stian initi@@ ative , but that it &apos;s coming , as it were , from the united nations , from the world -- who would help with the sort of bureau@@ cr@@ acy of this .
en face or three-@@ quar@@ ters .
i couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when i first saw that .
&lt; speaker &gt; christop@@ her de@@ char@@ ms &lt; / speaker &gt;
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therap@@ ist &apos;s cou@@ ch , p@@ ills and the kni@@ fe .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
so , i &apos;m not going to talk about that .
what i ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomen@@ ally good at text messa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bow@@ ling together ?
could somebody put this guy up ?
oh , cool . i can get to this place over here , right ?
none of this open-@@ to-@@ chap@@ ter@@ -@@ seven@@ -@@ and-@@ do@@ -@@ all-@@ the-@@ od@@ d-@@ proble@@ m-@@ sets .
it &apos;s 1.@@ 7@@ 6 kil@@ o@@ her@@ tz . i measure its wa@@ vel@@ ength .
there &apos;s a ri@@ ot going on on campus , and the police are ch@@ as@@ ing me , right ?
a dom@@ e , one of these ten@@ -@@ foot dom@@ es .
now we have the good fortun@@ e to open up space .
. thank you , chris .
and the old lady said , &quot; oh yes , come on in . &quot;
why did the universe emer@@ ge from the big bang the way it did ?
why would they appear only to c@@ ran@@ ks and weir@@ do@@ s ?
ca : professor haw@@ king , thank you for that answer .
in order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis .
that puts a lot of pressure on green@@ land .
from laugh@@ s to te@@ ars -- this is one of the older to@@ bac@@ co commerci@@ als .
but geo@@ ther@@ mal , concentr@@ ating solar , advanced photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ics , efficiency and conservation .
a challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? i think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gra@@ titude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , phil@@ harmon@@ ic or@@ ch@@ est@@ ras and poe@@ ts and sing@@ ers will celebr@@ ate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis
we need help . we need help .
so , as researchers , something that we often do is use im@@ men@@ se resources to achieve certain cap@@ abilities , or achieve certain goals .
another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots , so this is actually a multi-@@ touch , interac@@ tive wh@@ ite@@ board system as well .
so , that &apos;s my first idea . and we all know about the mo@@ z@@ art effect -- the idea that &apos;s been around for the last five to 10 years -- that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby &#91; in u@@ ter@@ o &#93; , that it &apos;ll raise our i@@ q points 10 , 20 , 30 percent .
it &apos;s very , very important .
it &apos;s the activity that seems to acceler@@ ate people &apos;s treatment the most
and then they can also , when you sna@@ p , line up exactly the way you &apos;d like to .
he &apos;s very sh@@ y , too .
in fact , this is the score for dan &apos;s piece , completely comp@@ os@@ ed by dan in hyper@@ score .
yo@@ cha@@ i ben@@ kl@@ er : the new open-source economics
capacity in the hands of the entire population , and we &apos;ve got human creativity , human wisdom , human experience -- the other major experience , the other major input --
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is out@@ sour@@ cing the one most important thing -- the decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page r@@ ank .
you don &apos;t have to ask per@@ mission , as you do in a proper@@ ty-@@ based system .
i will deliver something based on what happens . it &apos;s very sc@@ ary -- that &apos;s what google does , essentially .
and in par@@ is , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c released its study con@@ fir@@ ming man &apos;s impact on global warming .
the real question : is this di@@ stor@@ ted world@@ view what we want for americans in our increasingly inter@@ connected world ?
i think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am i , why am i this particular person , why am i not black like everybody else ?
and this , then , led to my big questions .
there is also a big question of ambi@@ gu@@ ity .
that is the ambi@@ gu@@ ity in my life that really di@@ stur@@ bed me , and led me to write a book called &quot; saving fish from dro@@ w@@ ning . &quot;
not all of us can go to africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
another chance encoun@@ ter is when i went to a place -- i just was with some friends , and we dro@@ ve rand@@ om@@ ly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-@@ tou@@ ri@@ st location , a beautiful village , pri@@ st@@ ine .
the man &apos;s sons were ban@@ ished to live three kilometers away , in a co@@ w@@ shed .
or rather , if there is an answer , it is to re@@ mind myself that there is un@@ certain@@ ty in everything , and that is good , because then i will discover something new .
this is a year when einstein is bas@@ king in the g@@ low of having discovered the special theory of relati@@ vity and deci@@ des to take on a new project , to try to understand fully the grand , per@@ va@@ sive force of gravity .
and that is what got kal@@ u@@ za thinking .
we don &apos;t seem to see them .
super@@ str@@ ing theory -- what is it ? well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivi@@ sible , un@@ cu@@ tt@@ able constitu@@ ents making up everything in the world around us ?
it doesn &apos;t work in a universe with four dimensions of space , nor five , nor six .
this is an example of something known as a cal@@ ab@@ i@@ -@@ y@@ au shape -- name isn &apos;t all that important .
so , imagine we have a certain kind of partic@@ le called a gra@@ vit@@ on -- that &apos;s the kind of de@@ br@@ is we expect to be e@@ jec@@ ted out , if the extra dimensions are real .
now , there &apos;s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achie@@ vement .
and when the sun sh@@ ines , you get cop@@ i@@ ous qu@@ anti@@ ties of these things , called neutr@@ in@@ os , p@@ our@@ ing out .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atom@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ i stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
now when a partic@@ le moves through the universe , it can interact with these hig@@ gs particles .
which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simp@@ li@@ fic@@ ation . but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to uni@@ fy together , back at the big bang --
they then re-@@ collap@@ sed into another generation of stars and planets .
we have now enter@@ ed in the 6@@ x , the six@@ th major extin@@ ction on this planet .
after they spor@@ ul@@ ate , they do ro@@ t .
when you walk across landsc@@ apes , it le@@ aps up in the after@@ math of your foot@@ steps trying to gra@@ b de@@ br@@ is .
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it -- we had an astero@@ id impact .
the enz@@ y@@ mes re@@ manufac@@ tured the hydro@@ car@@ b@@ ons into car@@ bo@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates -- fun@@ g@@ al su@@ g@@ ars .
this mu@@ sh@@ room gro@@ ws in washington state , or@@ eg@@ on , northern california , british colum@@ bia , now thought to be extin@@ ct in europe .
i became interested in en@@ tom@@ op@@ a@@ tho@@ gen@@ ic fun@@ g@@ i -- fun@@ g@@ i that kill insects .
this could totally re@@ v@@ amp the pe@@ st@@ ici@@ de industri@@ es throughout the world .
i think enga@@ ging my@@ cel@@ ium can help save the world .
sometimes , you get disease organisms that don &apos;t rely on h@@ ost mo@@ bility at all for trans@@ mission .
remember the second question that i raised at the out@@ set was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evol@@ ve to be mil@@ d ?
there &apos;s a little eth@@ ical problem in this experiment .
they evolved to produce less tox@@ in .
so , we can go to the same countries and look and see . did chil@@ e avoid the problem of antibio@@ tic resistance ,
and there &apos;s a really wonderful experiment that was done that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this .
but that &apos;s when you should be favor@@ ing evolution towards mil@@ dness .
so the other thing i really like about this , be@@ sides the fact that it brings a whole new dimen@@ sion into the study of control of disease , is that often the kinds of interven@@ tions that you want , that it indic@@ ates should be done , are the kinds of interven@@ tions that people want any@@ how .
and after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; look , you know , you go@@ tta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the ven@@ ding machine . &quot;
so bird coun@@ ts are indic@@ ating that we might be seeing up to exponenti@@ al growth in their numbers .
and were enter@@ ta@@ ined to discover that for the rest of the week , these cro@@ ws , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these cro@@ ws would ca@@ w at them , and run around and make their life kind of mis@@ er@@ able .
which is really useful if you live in a city .
cro@@ ws , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
i write about food . i write about coo@@ king .
there &apos;s no question , none , that so-@@ called life@@ style diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stro@@ ke , some can@@ c@@ ers -- are diseases that are far more pre@@ valent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
another red her@@ ring might be ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fied by the word &quot; lo@@ ca@@ vor@@ e , &quot; which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dic@@ tionary .
you just ate .
if we had a slide of s@@ alis@@ bur@@ y ste@@ ak , even more so , right ?
this kind of coo@@ king dro@@ ve me to learn how to c@@ ook for myself .
meat , jun@@ k food , che@@ ese :
the most common argument is that we need nutri@@ ents -- even though we eat , on average , twice as much protein as even the indu@@ str@@ y-@@ obse@@ ssed us@@ da re@@ com@@ men@@ ds .
less meat , less jun@@ k , more plants .
why ? why are we looking up ? is it because it &apos;s hea@@ ven ?
and we &apos;re leaving so much on the table , 72 percent of the planet .
and like a living organis@@ m , you te@@ ar it open , it ble@@ eds its mol@@ ten blood , ri@@ ses up to he@@ al that w@@ ound from the as@@ th@@ en@@ osp@@ here , har@@ dens , forms new tissue and moves lat@@ er@@ ally .
and so we went along this mountain range , in an area along gal@@ ap@@ a@@ gos ri@@ ft , and did we find the missing heat .
they came across new creatures they had not seen before .
and yet we &apos;re only now pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ating it .
and i was looking at it yesterday , it &apos;s up in seat@@ tle . ok .
we have sti@@ ff competition and we need to motiv@@ ate and it &apos;s all being done .
i mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spea@@ r from this sol@@ dier .
it wasn &apos;t what i wanted to do .
and the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustain@@ ability , about lower power consumption .
this is called y water , and it &apos;s this guy from los angeles , thomas ar@@ n@@ dt , au@@ stri@@ an origin@@ ally , who came to us ,
so , i was convinced . we designed it to be ic@@ onic , to look different . to look like it &apos;s for a kid , but not like a to@@ y .
i mean , they &apos;re being inst@@ alled in hom@@ eless clin@@ ics -- everywhere .
i would make things for people as a way of , you know , giving , showing them my love .
that &apos;s pretty ambi@@ gu@@ ous .
for me , it &apos;s kind of a feeling about the fle@@ et@@ ing@@ ness of the present moment , and i wanted to express that .
and , in a case like this , i &apos;m trying to make something which is clear but also not suggesti@@ ve of any particular kind of animal or plant .
and when i had this thought , i was imag@@ ining that i would make -- i would have a whole machine theater even@@ ing , where i would -- you would have an audience , the cur@@ tain would open , and you &apos;d be enter@@ ta@@ ined by machines on stage .
and by the time i was an inter@@ n house offic@@ er , i could bar@@ ely afford to main@@ tain my mother &apos;s 13@@ -year-old car --
what &apos;s the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes dis@@ ab@@ led ?
we all went out and did a mission and we &apos;ve done three of them so far .
well , no@@ wa@@ days everything &apos;s on pa@@ x anyway .
and that &apos;s a perfect example of one .
and lots and lots of that little bit down there , sac@@ ri@@ f@@ ice .
do you think there could ?
s@@ b : chaos ? no . what ? mind ? no .
all around us , still clu@@ m@@ s@@ ily dri@@ f@@ ting about in its pri@@ me@@ val sou@@ p of culture , is another replic@@ ator .
all right everyone , who &apos;s got some interesting me@@ mes for me ?
it &apos;s not surprising that you all found it when you arrived in your ba@@ th@@ rooms here .
cop@@ ying with vari@@ ation and selec@@ tion .
and we &apos;re getting there .
the fr@@ action of those that get the second replic@@ ator .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy out@@ put for two percent of your body weight ?
and why would they do that ? because we are self-@@ replic@@ ating .
paul col@@ lier : the &quot; bottom billion &quot;
europe had to be dra@@ gged into economic development .
we need to be at least as serious as we were then .
and the short run -- say , the first five to seven years -- is just great .
now , there &apos;s one big change since the com@@ modi@@ ty boo@@ ms of the 197@@ 0s , and that is the spread of democracy .
and the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extr@@ action .
. however , i have to say , the process of communication does not come naturally to me .
so , literally , a few minutes before that , i down@@ lo@@ aded this scientific paper about cal@@ cu@@ lations on a@@ vi@@ an de@@ fec@@ ation , which is really quite interesting , because it turns out you can model this as something called &quot; po@@ i@@ se@@ u@@ ille flow , &quot; and you can learn an awful lot about the physics of the a@@ vi@@ an rec@@ tum .
and then i met yo@@ yo , who is the n@@ ative rap@@ a nu@@ i@@ -@@ an gu@@ ide ,
not a joke .
we do a lot of work in bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ al fields .
so , the jo@@ die fo@@ ster character here is actually this woman , j@@ ill tar@@ ter ,
so , you hi@@ ke around and -- this is after you dig them up , they look like this .
here &apos;s a picture i took in the fal@@ k@@ land islands of king pengu@@ ins on a beach .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and that &apos;s the ultimate di@@ so@@ be@@ di@@ ence to authority .
because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera ,
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad app@@ les .
people say , &quot; no , that &apos;s na@@ zi germany , hit@@ ler , you know , that &apos;s 19@@ 3@@ 9 . &quot; he said , &quot; yeah , but suppose hit@@ ler asked you , &apos; would you electro@@ cu@@ te a stran@@ ger ? &apos; &apos; no way , i &apos;m a good person . &apos; &quot;
and the question is , who would go all the way to 4@@ 50 vol@@ ts ?
i did this study with my graduate students , especially cra@@ ig han@@ ey -- and it also began work with an ad .
they begin to do de@@ gra@@ ding activi@@ ties , like having them simul@@ ate so@@ dom@@ y .
pas@@ sive toler@@ ance of evil through in@@ action , or in@@ difference .
so i want to end very quickly on a positive note . hero@@ ism as the anti@@ do@@ te to evil ,
most people are gu@@ il@@ ty of the evil of in@@ action , because your mother said , &quot; don &apos;t get involved . mind your own business . &quot;
and so one day , you will be in a new situation .
by the time the last ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al dis@@ appeared in europe , 2@@ 7@@ ,000 years ago , our direct ance@@ stors had already , and for 5,000 years , been cra@@ w@@ ling into the bel@@ ly of the earth , where in the light of the f@@ lic@@ kers of tal@@ low cand@@ les , they had brought into being the great art of the up@@ per pal@@ e@@ oli@@ th@@ ic .
tens of thousands of islands fl@@ un@@ g like je@@ wel@@ s upon the southern sea .
the cause of suffering is ignor@@ ance .
it &apos;s kind of like an an@@ de@@ an w@@ ood@@ stock : 6@@ 0,000 indi@@ ans on pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to the end of a dir@@ t road that leads to the sac@@ red valley , called the sin@@ a@@ kar@@ a , which is domin@@ ated by three ton@@ gues of the great glac@@ ier .
now , the measure of a society is not only what it does , but the quality of its a@@ spi@@ ra@@ tions .
not simply to the f@@ lan@@ ks of the mountains , but to the very ic@@ ed pe@@ a@@ ks which are the de@@ stin@@ y of the pil@@ gri@@ ms .
two hours from mi@@ ami , there is an entire civilization of people pra@@ ying every day for your well-@@ being .
and there is indeed a fire bur@@ ning over the earth , taking with it not only plants and animals , but the leg@@ acy of humanity &apos;s brilli@@ ance .
but you get these resources together .
there are a large number of people on the internet , a very small fr@@ action of them have photos of the mer@@ ma@@ id para@@ de .
what f@@ lic@@ k@@ r does is it re@@ places planning with c@@ oor@@ din@@ ation .
and by the time you get to the middle , you &apos;ve got hundreds of people who have contribu@@ ted only one photo each .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ll do .
the bigger question is , what do you do about the value down here ?
and i use that word advi@@ se@@ dly .
they even have lance arm@@ stron@@ g-@@ style br@@ ac@@ el@@ ets , these red br@@ ac@@ el@@ ets , which signi@@ fy , in the small group , i am trying to main@@ tain my eating dis@@ order .
and so the point here is not , &quot; this is wonderful , &quot; or &quot; we &apos;re going to see a transition from only institutions to only cooper@@ ative frame@@ work . &quot;
i can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
and three of the smar@@ test people were stan ula@@ m , richard fe@@ yn@@ man and john v@@ on neu@@ mann . and it was v@@ on neu@@ mann who said , after the bom@@ b , he was working on something much more important than bom@@ bs : he &apos;s thinking about computers .
if you look at the orig@@ ins of this , the classi@@ c history sort of takes it all back to the eni@@ a@@ c here .
you can read the text .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing , this last six months , is going through the lo@@ gs .
so they really were working under tough conditions .
that was designed on that machine , in the woo@@ ds behind the institute .
they &apos;re not going to become organisms .

i see some of you recognize this child .
i moved his body while he was playing .
and the tele@@ phone . the tele@@ phone . if your mother calls on the mis@@ er@@ able tele@@ phone , she calls and says , &quot; hel@@ lo , &quot; you not only know who it is , you know what m@@ ood she &apos;s in .
comp@@ os@@ ers know that . if they want sad music , they just play those two notes .
that ch@@ or@@ d doesn &apos;t work .
at the end , they went crazy , cl@@ apping .
now , i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years old , i &apos;d been conduc@@ ting for 20 years , and i suddenly had a reali@@ zation .
she went to au@@ sch@@ wit@@ z when she was 15 years old . and ... and her brother was eight , and the parents were lost .

and after doing this for a long time , and the media lab passing the bat@@ on on , i thought , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s time for me to do a project . something that would be important , but also something that would take advantage of all of these privi@@ le@@ ges that one had . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s not a person in this room -- i don &apos;t care how tech@@ ie you are -- there &apos;s not a person in this room that doesn &apos;t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them de@@ bu@@ g it . ok ?
it allows you to team up with people . the u.@@ n. &apos; s not going to be our partner if we &apos;re profit making . so announ@@ cing this with kof@@ i ann@@ an was very important , and the u.@@ n. allowed us to basically reach all the countries . and this was the machine we were showing before i met y@@ ves beha@@ r .
because it &apos;s cheap , in the pe@@ jor@@ ative sense , as well as in@@ expensive .
so what i want to end with is sort of what we &apos;re doing to roll it out .
the first day it was just wild . and then we said , &quot; well , let &apos;s get people to give many . not just one , and get one , but maybe give 100 , give 1,000 . &quot; and that &apos;s where you come in .
and the world production today , everybody combin@@ ed , making lap@@ tops , is five million a month . so i &apos;m standing here telling you that some@@ time next year , we &apos;re going to make 20 percent of the world production .
you do it again and again .
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what we@@ igh@@ t@@ less@@ ness was truly like .
as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation -- in the &apos; 8@@ 0s -- of students who were prote@@ sting a military dict@@ at@@ or@@ ship , which has finally ended .

so , this guy comes with me . and i don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever heard a go@@ at , or seen one -- they sound like human beings ,

and like a lot of photograph@@ ers and a lot of journali@@ sts , i always hope that when my pictures were published , they might actually have an effect on a situation , instead of just documen@@ ting it .
the way they heat their homes in korea is to put bri@@ cks under the flo@@ ors , so the heat actually radi@@ ates from underneath the floor .
they would actually cover the windows every night , so that light couldn &apos;t be seen , because the south kore@@ an government has said for years that the north kore@@ ans may inva@@ de at any time .
and my friends actually said they were very interested in adop@@ ting her .
i said , &quot; well , tell him that i was asked by this little girl &apos;s grandmother to find a family for her . &quot;
so , these two came to lunch , and we got thro@@ wn out of the restaurant .
this is father ke@@ ene . he &apos;s just a wonderful guy .
they really wanted to be able to wel@@ come hy@@ un@@ -@@ s@@ ook into their family .
so , sure enough , it &apos;s one o &apos;@@ clock , room &apos;s free@@ zing , i go to close the window , and i hear people shou@@ ting outside , and i thought , &quot; oh , the b@@ ars must have just gotten out . &quot;
and gene , who &apos;s lying on the floor , says , &quot; man , we &apos;ve got to so@@ ak to@@ wel@@ s . &quot; i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
this is the elders teaching gene their dan@@ ces .
she never liked it very much .

now , at this stage , we decided to start a company and move this further ,
first , starting with a push from the right .
so this character is going to be hit by a force , it &apos;s going to realize it &apos;s in the air , and it &apos;s going to try and , well , stick out its arm in the direction where it &apos;s land@@ ing .
now , this could do with a bit more work . it &apos;s still very early sta@@ ges , and we pretty much just did this for a lau@@ gh , just to see what we &apos;d get out of it .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
it was the best month of my life , because i just sat back and i read books and watched movies .
so i decided , what if you really did take the bi@@ ble literally ?
that one i followed by de@@ fa@@ ult , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing ne@@ ar@@ by , looking like she had a strong gri@@ p .
and i said , &quot; well , that would be great ! &quot;
it &apos;s just that their faith is so strong in this liter@@ al interpre@@ tation of the bi@@ ble that they di@@ stor@@ t all the data to fit their model .
after three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he &apos;s like , &quot; i go@@ tta go . &quot;
you have to pick and choose . and anyone who follo@@ ws the bi@@ ble is going to be pic@@ king and cho@@ os@@ ing .
it was actually a terrible disaster for prin@@ ce@@ ton .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
you can imagine that the plants growing up like kel@@ p through crac@@ ks in the ice , growing on the surface .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it .
none of these spec@@ ula@@ tions may have any basis in fact .
that would be a fun thing to do .
and as the sun sets behind her temp@@ le in the af@@ tern@@ oon , it perfectly ba@@ thes his temp@@ le with her sha@@ dow .

and by parallel sum@@ mary , i want to say the same thing about technology , about entertainment and design , because i think the issues are very similar .
we for@@ got about a mission to make relatively un@@ trou@@ b@@ led people happ@@ ier , more ful@@ filled , more productive . and &quot; geni@@ us , &quot; &quot; high-@@ talent , &quot; became a dir@@ ty word .
each of them is in a roman@@ tic relationship and each has a rich re@@ per@@ to@@ ire of friends .
it &apos;s all like french van@@ illa ice cre@@ am , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you &apos;re down to the six@@ th taste , it &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re one with the music . time stop@@ s .
so we do random as@@ sign@@ ment , plac@@ e@@ bo controlled , long-term studies of different interven@@ tions .
and our results surprised us , but they were back@@ ward of what we thought .
but once you frac@@ tion@@ ate happiness the way i do -- not just positive emotion , that &apos;s not nearly enough -- there &apos;s flow in life , and there &apos;s meaning in life .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce con@@ temporary products , away from the eth@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more con@@ temporary .
we are the species called homo s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens s@@ ap@@ i@@ ens , and it &apos;s important to remember that , in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet earth .
not many people can say that .
here &apos;s some re@@ construc@@ tions of some of the fos@@ s@@ ils that have been found from lake tur@@ kan@@ a .

you can see here , again , taken from al gore &apos;s book . but what &apos;s happened is our technology has re@@ moved the chec@@ ks and bal@@ an@@ ces on our population growth .
anyway , it was a time when i was main@@ ly interested in collec@@ ting imagin@@ ary stories .
so , i started to write computer programs that study very , very large sets of these online foot@@ prin@@ ts .
you can also stop a rain@@ drop and open the feeling inside .
this is the wh@@ aling camp here , we &apos;re about six miles from sh@@ ore ,
and so i thought it would be interesting to build a frame@@ work to surface those types of stories . so , in the case of &quot; the wh@@ ale hun@@ t , &quot; how could we extr@@ act something like the story of si@@ me@@ on and cra@@ w@@ ford , invol@@ ving the concep@@ ts of wild@@ life , tools and blood , taking place on the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean , domin@@ ated by the color red , happening around 10 a.@@ m@@ . on may 3 , with an exc@@ it@@ ement level of high ?
and we could do something as ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary as , say , extr@@ act the story of ron@@ y , invol@@ ving the concep@@ ts of blood and wh@@ ales and tools , taking place on the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean , at a@@ h@@ ki@@ v@@ ga@@ q camp , with the he@@ art@@ beat level of fast .
and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happ@@ ie@@ st day in their life , what makes them happy .

because if architecture is what i believe it to be , which is the built form of our cultural ambi@@ tions , what do you do when presen@@ ted with an opportunity to rec@@ ti@@ fy a situation that represents somebody else &apos;s cultural ambi@@ tions rel@@ ative to us ?
in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of techno@@ cra@@ tic solution to everything -- that there is a large , technical answer that can solve all problems , be they social , be they physical , be they chemical -- or something that &apos;s more of a roman@@ tic solution .
and projects it on a page , and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it .

but if that &apos;s happened in the last 5,000 days , what &apos;s going to happen in the next 5,000 days ?
of course , the memory is really huge .
and everything will go through the web .
the reason why things are free is so that you can manipul@@ ate them ,
we &apos;re now enter@@ ing to the third stage , which is what i &apos;m talking about , and that is where we link the data .
a se@@ man@@ tic web , web 3@@ .@@ 0 , giant global graph --
so the next 5,000 days , it &apos;s not going to be the web and only better .
and the one is us . we are in the one .
that &apos;s 10 to the six@@ teen@@ th . and they consu@@ me one and a half me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts of power .
the net is doing the work in the brain .
now , this is starting to happen in transi@@ stors .
and it &apos;s brit@@ tle , because each of these steps has to be fla@@ w@@ less , otherwise you lose that data , whereas in the brain , you have a system that stor@@ es data in a distribu@@ ted way , and it &apos;s robu@@ st .
when k@@ are@@ em moves his head to the right , you will see this blue activity there ;
it was very bru@@ te force ; it was very in@@ ele@@ gant .
if you look close , it &apos;s this shape , called a c@@ ran@@ e .
and they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
i mean , a sta@@ g bee@@ tle -- it &apos;s got two points for ja@@ ws , it &apos;s got an@@ ten@@ na@@ e . can you be that specific in the detail ? &quot;
well , there are other ways of making a fla@@ p .
but computers -- you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms , and with this , we could .
and what this has allowed is the creation of orig@@ am@@ i@@ -@@ on-@@ demand .
there were two groups of people who were interested in this : plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , who want to look up , and then other people , who wanted to look down .
so they need to figure out how , in a computer , to f@@ lat@@ ten an air@@ bag .
and ru@@ f@@ us is going to be doing some impro@@ vis@@ ation on his cu@@ st@@ om , fi@@ ve-@@ str@@ ing electric cel@@ lo , and it &apos;s very exciting to listen to him .
now , the problem of human diversity , like all big scientific questions -- how do you explain something like that -- can be broken down into sub-@@ questions .
if they were pe@@ ering over your shoul@@ der , you wouldn &apos;t lea@@ p back , like that . what about our human ance@@ stry ?
and he talked about afri@@ c@@ ans and americans and a@@ si@@ ans and europe@@ ans , and a b@@ lat@@ antly rac@@ ist categ@@ ory he ter@@ med &quot; mon@@ str@@ os@@ us , &quot; which basically inclu@@ ded all the people he didn &apos;t like , including imagin@@ ary fol@@ k like el@@ ves .
it &apos;s comp@@ os@@ ed of four sub@@ un@@ its : a , c , g and t , we call them .
turn them on their sides , comb@@ ine them so that they look like a tree with the r@@ oot at the bottom and the bran@@ ches going up .
what was going on to the world &apos;s weather around 6@@ 0,000 years ago ?
the ones on the left are from africa , from around a million years ago .

and it has become a wild success , t@@ apping into the en@@ thu@@ si@@ ast photograph@@ y community .
the her@@ d was safe within the con@@ fin@@ es of the park , because of this dedic@@ ated group of park ran@@ gers .
sometimes , though , the only way to tell a story is with a swe@@ ep@@ ing picture .
jim took what could have been a stra@@ igh@@ t-@@ up medical science story and gave it a human dimen@@ sion that tou@@ ched our rea@@ ders deeply .
paul set out to photograph a relatively mysteri@@ ous and un@@ known cre@@ ature , and came back with not just a collection of photographs , but an amazing experience and a great story .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : physici@@ st patri@@ cia bur@@ ch@@ at she@@ ds light on two basic ingredi@@ ents of our universe : dark matter and dark energy . comp@@ ri@@ sing 9@@ 6 % of the universe between them , they can &apos;t be directly measu@@ red , but their influence is im@@ men@@ se .
in other words , if we measu@@ red speed as a function of distance -- this is the only time i &apos;m going to show a graph , ok -- we would expect that it goes down as the distance incre@@ ases from the center of the galaxy .
so here &apos;s an obser@@ ver : it could be an eye ; it could be a telescope .
now , it will only be a perfect ring if the source , the def@@ lec@@ tor and the e@@ ye@@ ball , in this case , are all in a perfectly straight line .
well , first of all , for the gol@@ den shape galaxies -- those are the galaxies in the clu@@ ster .
but because gra@@ vit@@ ation@@ ally attrac@@ ting matter is em@@ bed@@ ded in this space , it tends to slow down the ex@@ pan@@ sion of the space , ok .
so by looking at things like clu@@ sters of galaxies , and how they -- their number den@@ sity , how many there are as a function of time -- we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy compe@@ te against each other in structure forming .
and finally , for future en@@ dea@@ vor@@ s , there are teles@@ cop@@ es being designed specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy -- gr@@ oun@@ d-@@ based teles@@ cop@@ es , and there are three spac@@ e-@@ based teles@@ cop@@ es that are in competition right now to be launched to investig@@ ate dark matter and dark energy .
forward , don &apos;t move the w@@ ri@@ st .
so we have an agre@@ ement .
im@@ pre@@ ssive . thank you .
i &apos;m jo@@ king , yeah ?
then you have to push it down again .

if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you fli@@ p a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .

and you can make a map of the americ@@ as and spel@@ l dna with dna . and what &apos;s really ne@@ at about it -- well , actually , this all looks like nan@@ o-@@ art@@ work ,
we &apos;re going to turn to another technology ,
and the ne@@ at thing about it is , is that it &apos;s also re@@ program@@ ma@@ ble .
so it &apos;s got some err@@ ors , but at least it coun@@ ts up .
and i find that the seven@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds do mar@@ gin@@ ally better than the other audi@@ ences , which is some@@ what surprising .
and so , there &apos;s a whole lot of people saying , &quot; i &apos;d be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air .
if you believe , as most of you probably do , that it &apos;s ho@@ tter in summer than in winter because we &apos;re closer to the sun , you must have dra@@ wn an el@@ li@@ p@@ se .

that is the call that chimpan@@ ze@@ es make before they go to sleep in the even@@ ing .

and yet we &apos;re destro@@ ying the only home we have .
i asked a question . &quot; why ? &quot;
just pic@@ king one or two of the projects right here in africa that the roots and shoo@@ ts groups are doing , one or two projects only -- in tan@@ zan@@ ia , in ug@@ anda , kenya , south africa , con@@ go@@ -@@ bra@@ z@@ za@@ ville , sier@@ ra le@@ one , camer@@ oon and other groups . and as i say , it &apos;s in 9@@ 7 countries around the world .
and choose to make these choices with the question , how will this affect the environment around me ?
and just a last word on that -- the young woman who &apos;s running this entire conference center , i met her today .
you can understand why artists are so different from accoun@@ tan@@ ts .
when the liber@@ al team los@@ es , as it did in 2004 , and as it almost did in 2000 , we comfort ourselves .
we &apos;re all mamm@@ als here , we all have a lot of ne@@ ural and hor@@ mon@@ al programm@@ ing that makes us really b@@ ond with others , care for others , feel compassion for others , especially the we@@ ak and vulnerable .
i think this is what we come with , at least a prepar@@ ed@@ ness to learn all of these things .
i &apos;ll just fli@@ p through a few other sli@@ des .
some of you might recognize this as the &apos; 6@@ 0s .
some people think that religion is an adap@@ tation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to co@@ here , in part for the purpose of tru@@ sting each other , and then being more effective at compe@@ ting with other groups .

of the united states and the so@@ vi@@ et union .
now the od@@ d thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization ob@@ liter@@ ation , we engaged in america in a series -- and in fact , in the so@@ vi@@ et union -- in a series of response planning .
turns out that they had another idea behind it , even though this was -- they were telling the public it was to save us .
and , in fact , lots of sites where fis@@ sion@@ able materials , like highly en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ an@@ ium and plu@@ ton@@ ium , are absolutely not safe .
there &apos;s deta@@ iled information on how to assemb@@ le a nuclear weap@@ on from parts .
five to seven percent only are in@@ spec@@ ted -- five to seven percent .
here we go . ok .
over the next few days to a week , there will be a radiation cloud , again , going with the wind , and sett@@ ling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case , over long island .
and shel@@ ter and place . you want to move &#91; only &#93; cros@@ s@@ wind for 1.@@ 2 miles .
this is argu@@ ably the back end of the design of animals .
and they said , &quot; ah , no problem ! we just get out and walk . &quot;
go underneath it . go above it . go around it .
it &apos;s this hair that &apos;s above the eyes , and below it , it &apos;s longer .
and it makes him very dangerous at this time of year .

jac@@ ki@@ e o@@ . once said that traveling by ca@@ mel made ri@@ ding an eleph@@ ant seem like taking a jet plane .
we really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children .
if you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available , well , how big a problem is it ?
it costs about three dollars to down@@ load , print and b@@ ind a normal , old book .
something else i &apos;m quite excited about in this particular dom@@ ain , beyond these sort of ki@@ os@@ k-@@ y things where you can get books on demand , is some of these new little scre@@ ens that are coming out .
and we tried these robot things , and they worked pretty well -- sort of these au@@ to-@@ pa@@ ge-@@ turning things .
and we &apos;re starting to move out of the just out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right into the out@@ -@@ of-@@ print world .
they give per@@ mission , and we get about 40 or 50 concer@@ ts a day .
and we &apos;ve got , now , a lot of these materials .
how do we go and have a world where we both have libr@@ aries and publi@@ shing in the future , just as we basically benef@@ ited as we were growing up ?
i said , &quot; you &apos;re a pe@@ ach , ma . pop there ? &quot;
there are stories you tell from sta@@ ges .
i called my mother , and she said , &quot; car@@ men , i need you to come , please .
and she &apos;s j@@ ing@@ ling , j@@ ang@@ ling a pair of keys .
and so we left my father fast as@@ le@@ ep , because i knew he &apos;d kill me if i let her go by her@@ self , and we get in the car .
so i look up and i &apos;m thinking , maybe he &apos;s still going to think i &apos;m kind of cu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; it will up@@ set you . &quot;
she has amazing land speed for a woman her age , too .
there she is .
&quot; i &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
the boy , now , he says . &quot; well , what my sister meant &quot; -- they look at each other , it &apos;s a knowing g@@ lance -- &quot; god , she &apos;s crazy ! &quot;
everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
one of my big so@@ ap@@ box@@ es right now is antibio@@ tics .
and what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick . we &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
it &apos;s because of the way the government com@@ modi@@ fi@@ es food ,
we really need to change this whole paradig@@ m with kids and food .
you know , run up into the end of the rain@@ bo@@ w ,
so we &apos;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educ@@ ational system .
you know , it &apos;s crazy . it &apos;s crazy what we &apos;re doing .
you know what ? we should be as@@ ha@@ med .
and i asked myself , why ?
you could abu@@ se it .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 35@@ 1 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and then notice that a great many of these problems dis@@ appear .
i think the big problem is that we &apos;re not smart enough to understand which of the problems we &apos;re facing are good enough .
and so there won &apos;t be any work@@ force .
thank you .
what &apos;s the single most important thing you &apos;ve got to con@@ ve@@ y ? what ?
and you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going .
i need to know you have the ability to listen .
you stop , you need to figure out a nice , lo@@ gical progre@@ ssion .
one may have been gr@@ os@@ s sal@@ es , one may have been net sal@@ es , but i want to know that all the numbers make sense together .
what do you do ? best of all , images . just a simple image .
if it &apos;s a website , show me a scre@@ en@@ shot of your website .
we &apos;ll have 1,000 custom@@ ers this year and 10,000 the next ,
so how do i know what &apos;s going on ?

well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random .
also , even if we were born with certain ig@@ no@@ ble moti@@ ves , they don &apos;t automati@@ cally lead to ig@@ no@@ ble behavior .
so let me tell you what ar@@ ous@@ ed such ir@@ ate respon@@ ses , and i &apos;ll let you decide if whether they -- the cla@@ ims are really that ou@@ trage@@ ous .
well , here &apos;s a diagnos@@ is .
well , the other hot bu@@ tton is par@@ en@@ ting .
the choice is whether certain facts about humans , or top@@ ics , are to be considered tab@@ oos , for@@ bi@@ dden knowledge , where we shouldn &apos;t go there because no good can come from it , or whether we should explore them hon@@ est@@ ly .
and on the left there is a platform from evolution robo@@ tics , where you put a p@@ c on , and you program this thing with a gu@@ i to w@@ ander around your house and do various stuff .
on board that robot is a p@@ c running lin@@ u@@ x .
very ho@@ st@@ ile environments , 150 ˚ c , 10,000 ps@@ i .
i just want to show you one technical diagram here .
and when i was dealing with my robot over here , chris , the robot , was meas@@ uring the pros@@ o@@ dy in my voice ,
i want to show you my watch . &quot; and he brings the watch center , into the robot &apos;s field of vision , points to it , gives it a motion cu@@ e , and the robot looks at the watch quite success@@ fully .
150 years ago , with darwin , we had to give up the idea we were different from animals .
i was here about four years ago , talking about the relationship of design and happiness .
everybody particip@@ ated -- mil@@ ton gla@@ ser ,
in the space of concep@@ tual design .
you can show a mos@@ que , or you can show wor@@ shi@@ p@@ pers , but there &apos;s not a stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward way of de@@ pic@@ ting islam .
so the risks are very great .
we wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere .
it was kind of a meaning machine that everybody kind of la@@ id on their own mean@@ ings off of .
so , the dr@@ ill was moun@@ ted on this robo@@ tic arm .
then you come up in this glass ele@@ v@@ ator right near the cur@@ tain wall .
so , this is the en@@ tran@@ ce to t@@ ully hall as it used to be , before the ren@@ o@@ v@@ ation , which we just started .
but one more added fe@@ ature .
and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of con@@ science , change became not only possible , but inevit@@ able .
the school i went to was pretty bor@@ ing .
the graph@@ ics were just horri@@ ble .

you need to be really an incredible artist .
from an early age i learned to invest myself emo@@ tionally in what un@@ fol@@ ded before me on screen .
no bu@@ tt@@ ons to push , no tri@@ g@@ gers to pull , just me and the game .
but maybe bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ing isn &apos;t always bad .
some of the ideas are really dre@@ ad@@ ful and some of them are great .

and i walked out , and this really mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous thing happened to me as i was walking north to buy this air fil@@ ter , which was that the streets were completely alive with people .
everybody contribu@@ tes a little bit .
but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deci@@ ding to link to my page or not link to it , and google just sitting there and running the numbers .
there &apos;s a problem with the google ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist ,
you can see we &apos;re in the as@@ co@@ t , which is always good .
and this is basically the distribution of links on the web to all these various different blogs .

obviously the answer to this question is not going to be a single factor . if anyone tells you that there is a sing@@ le-@@ factor explan@@ ation for socie@@ tal collap@@ ses , you know right away that they &apos;re an idi@@ ot . this is a complex subject . but how can we make sense out of the complex@@ i@@ ties of this subject ?

in fact , you can find that the lack of basic resources , material resources , contribu@@ tes to un@@ happiness , but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness .
and in order to hear me and understand what i &apos;m saying , you need to process about 60 bits per second .
it happens also , actually , in the most recent book i wrote , called &quot; good business , &quot; where i intervie@@ wed some of the ce@@ os who had been n@@ om@@ in@@ ated by their pe@@ ers as being both very successful and very eth@@ ical , very soci@@ ally responsible .
and then the other areas become less and less positive .

it &apos;s going to push this energy lim@@ it seven times beyond what &apos;s ever been done before ,
and it seems strange that nature would have so many ele@@ mentary particles .
so these patterns of char@@ ges are not just pretty .
this particular choice cor@@ respon@@ ds to a grand uni@@ fied theory introduced by pat@@ i and sal@@ am in 197@@ 3 .
from their location in this pattern , we know that these new particles should be sc@@ al@@ ar fields like the hig@@ gs partic@@ le , but have color charge and interact with the strong force .
in this reg@@ ard , new physics the@@ ories are a lot like star@@ t-@@ up companies .
so are you saying that we should think of the universe , at its heart -- that the sm@@ alle@@ st things that there are , are somehow an e@@ 8 object of possibility ?

and before i la@@ unch into the disp@@ lay of some of the sli@@ des and into the pre@@ view , i would like to point out this beautiful detail about scientists and design .
in this case too , you have a mix@@ ture of scientists and designers .
you see here the work of ben f@@ ry . this is &quot; human v@@ s. ch@@ im@@ ps &quot; -- the few chromos@@ om@@ es that di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish us from ch@@ im@@ ps .
it used to be called rap@@ id proto@@ typ@@ ing , rap@@ id model@@ ing .
another shape is made for cancer .
so it &apos;s a series of dol@@ ls that he &apos;s working on right now .
he was talking about the space ali@@ ens .
but it is strange .
&quot; oh , &quot; he said , &quot; little green men . &quot;
she had long , cur@@ ly black hair , a blue je@@ an jac@@ ket .
please .
four : this was being shown in a regular movie theater in center city , phil@@ a@@ del@@ phi@@ a .
clu@@ ster@@ ing into a kind of a tan .
and then , in the middle of a sentence , at the very birth of t@@ wi@@ light , i turned and looked down the street .
sex ti@@ ps are not glam@@ or@@ ous .
and this is he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .
this is fi@@ li@@ pp@@ ino li@@ pp@@ i &apos;s 15@@ 4@@ 3 portra@@ it of sa@@ int apol@@ lon@@ ia .
and this sense of being transpor@@ ted is one reason that we have glam@@ our sty@@ ling .
this is what the real world of computers , lam@@ ps , electrical app@@ li@@ an@@ ces of all kinds , looks like .
the white pic@@ ket f@@ ence , the perfect house .
this is from &quot; tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h of the will &quot; -- brilliant edi@@ ting to cut together things .
but i also knew how hard they worked all week .
so , within that larger context , we can talk about diet , stress management -- which are really these spiritu@@ al practic@@ es --
the youn@@ ger brother is 8@@ 6 , the older one ’ s 95 ; they wanted to show me how much more flexi@@ ble they were .
what was the biggest selling drug of all time
and if you see from &apos; 85 to &apos; 8@@ 6 to &apos; 87 , &apos; 8@@ 8 , &apos; 8@@ 9 , &apos; 90 , &apos; 9@@ 1 -- you get a new categ@@ ory , 15 to 20 percent ; &apos; 92 , &apos; 9@@ 3 , &apos; 9@@ 4 , &apos; 95 , &apos; 9@@ 6 , &apos; 9@@ 7 -- you get a new categ@@ ory ; &apos; 9@@ 8 , &apos; 99 , 2000 , and 2001 .
so , and you get all the dise@@ a@@ se-@@ prote@@ c@@ tive sub@@ stances .
so , an opti@@ mal diet is low in fat , low in the bad car@@ bs , high in the good car@@ bs and enough of the good f@@ ats .
it can be sexual inti@@ m@@ acy – i happen to think that heal@@ ing energy and ero@@ tic energy are just different forms of the same thing .

they are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and , to some ex@@ tent , the repu@@ t@@ ational capital that they gain from doing a good job .
but what the blo@@ g@@ osp@@ here off@@ ers is the possibility of getting at the kind of collective , distribu@@ tive intelligence that is out there , and that we know is available to us if we can just figure out a way of ac@@ cess@@ ing it .
but we know that occa@@ sion@@ ally ants go a@@ stra@@ y ,
imagine if you were qui@@ et for 17 years and your mother was out in the audience , say .
i didn ’ t know about the environment then .
&quot; what , what , what ? &quot;
so i did that .
my dad came out to see me graduate and , you know , i did the deal , and my father said , &quot; we ’ re really proud of you son , but ... &quot;
well , my journey kept going on .
i was walking through el dor@@ a@@ do -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or in@@ famous prison -- in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , and i don ’ t know what pos@@ se@@ ssed me , because this was not like me .
i know i needed to change , because it would be the only way that i could be here today .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neigh@@ bor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
he knew that friend@@ ship is a short cut to play .
so come on ! there we go , there we go . thank you . thank you . oh .
one of them might be , you know , when we see this funny stri@@ p@@ y thing : is that a ti@@ ger just about to jump out and kill us ?
so , who got more than five circ@@ les figured out ?
and he asked them to come along one even@@ ing , and to bring a problem with them that they were working on .
and we ’ ve certainly lear@@ nt that over time , you get much better bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming , much more creative out@@ comes when everybody does play by the rules .
they were meeting with them ; they were talking to the sur@@ ge@@ ons about what it was they needed with this device .
so we do quite a lot of work at ide@@ o trying to convince our cli@@ ents of this .
so any@@ how , he went there with his video camera , and it ’ s kind of interesting to see what he brought back .
but everybody agre@@ ed to play a game where the worst s@@ ket@@ ch artist bought the next round of drin@@ ks .
building , and thinking with your hands ;
smell has this repu@@ tation of being some@@ what different for each person .
and the at@@ tr@@ action , the forces , between the molecule and the protein cause the motion . this is a shap@@ e-@@ based idea .
s-@@ h , quite a different frequ@@ ency .
bob jac@@ klo@@ v@@ ich and john lam@@ b at ford motor company , in the days when ford motor was spending vast amoun@@ ts of money on fundamental research , discovered a way to build a spec@@ tr@@ os@@ cope that was intr@@ in@@ sically nan@@ o-@@ scale .

but we ’ re all discipl@@ ined by the understanding that the only people who are going to decide , you know , whether i ’ m right or somebody else is right , are the people in our community in the next generation , in 30 and 50 years .
so this is the found@@ ations of what ’ s called , tradi@@ tionally , liber@@ al political theory and new@@ ton@@ ian physics .
there must be mechanis@@ ms of self-@@ organization inside the universe that make things .
and you understand some things better than other things ,
and that was that an american congre@@ ss@@ woman named patri@@ cia sch@@ roe@@ der from color@@ a@@ do met with a group of journali@@ sts .
and one that looks de@@ st@@ ined , in fact , to be permanent .
it will ref@@ er you directly to your congre@@ s@@ sper@@ son , to your u.s. sen@@ ator , to your gover@@ nor where di@@ ve@@ st@@ ment leg@@ is@@ lation is pen@@ ding .
so we have achie@@ ved an awful lot rel@@ ative to the 20th century , and yet far too little rel@@ ative to the gravity of the crime that is un@@ fol@@ ding as we sit here , as we speak .
they &apos;re in some ways using the bush administ@@ ration as an ali@@ bi .

well , if you den@@ oun@@ ce , you &apos;re probably never going to get back in the room .
which is how i would have fra@@ med the question .
whether it &apos;s ni@@ x@@ on going to china or k@@ h@@ ru@@ sh@@ che@@ v and ken@@ ne@@ dy or re@@ ag@@ an and gor@@ ba@@ che@@ v .
how si@@ sy@@ p@@ he@@ an this task was of men@@ ding ,
and now i really like sort of sitting up , you know .
whether they &apos;re kind of gl@@ ori@@ fied in this way , or whether they &apos;re kind of , you know , iron@@ ically gl@@ ori@@ fied , or whether they &apos;re , you know , sort of den@@ i@@ gr@@ ated , or iron@@ ically den@@ i@@ gr@@ ated . i go back to color all the time .
so in edi@@ ting these cli@@ ps , i didn &apos;t have the au@@ d@@ ac@@ ity to e@@ dit a clip of me singing at joe &apos;s pu@@ b .
i always say to my partner , mar@@ is@@ a gar@@ din@@ i , who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen .
ro@@ d : of course i want to look cu@@ te .
i for@@ got that i said that . but it &apos;s really true .
im : chur@@ ns ?
so , that &apos;s what we call our first five employees during the te@@ a break , you know , in here .
it &apos;s not very appropriate to do it now . some people tell me to do it ;
well , the way i think about it is fairly simple .
and if you look at the he@@ ight of it and you compare it to moun@@ t ever@@ est , you see , it &apos;ll give you an idea of how large that moun@@ t oly@@ m@@ pus , you know , is , rel@@ ative to moun@@ t ever@@ est .
well , here we are four years later , and they &apos;re still working .
it looks like i could have told you these are pictures taken from the sahar@@ a desert or somewhere , and you &apos;d have believed me , but these are pictures taken from mars .

now , &quot; the lor@@ d of the r@@ ings &quot; has two things played through it .
so as we fle@@ w by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
so it &apos;s very much like the cycle on earth except because it &apos;s so cold , it could not be water , you know , because water would have fro@@ zen .
i &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
at modern art . then i realized how , you know , the world of modern art is particularly top@@ sy@@ -@@ tur@@ vy .
ja , well i could have translat@@ ed that , but you would have been none the wis@@ er .
this is ja@@ sp@@ er joh@@ ns . we can see here he was practic@@ ing with his r@@ ul@@ er .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : ste@@ wart brand works on the clock of the long now , a ti@@ me@@ piece that coun@@ ts down the next 10,000 years . it &apos;s a beautiful project that asks us to think about the far , far future . here , he discus@@ ses a tri@@ cky side problem with the clock : where can we put it ?
that &apos;s what happens to buildings . they &apos;re vulnerable .
that &apos;s a 2@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ foot th@@ ick forma@@ tion , and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock .
at the end of it there &apos;s something physical , a kind of re@@ ward that you take away .
and realized that the bri@@ st@@ le@@ con@@ e p@@ ines -- he found some in the white mountains that were over 4@@ ,000 years old .
they don &apos;t quite meet .
you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain .
and it really is hidden . i can &apos;t find it in this image ,
and they &apos;re doing pretty well , but they &apos;ve got a bit of trouble .
but from the outside it should be invisible .
it is a story of hope , resi@@ li@@ ence and glam@@ our .
here i can tell a story of afri@@ c@@ ans making movies like i do , and actually i felt this was an inspi@@ ration for me .
they can afford to watch their &quot; robo@@ c@@ op &quot; and whatever .
ber@@ n@@ ard pin@@ a@@ y@@ on ag@@ ba@@ os@@ i : we have been so deep into the foreign movies .
woman : that &apos;s why i use enough mas@@ king tape .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can in@@ sp@@ ire us .
thank you very much .
and i have to say , this really pro@@ ves that story@@ telling , it &apos;s a com@@ modi@@ ty , it &apos;s a stap@@ le .
so there &apos;s a couple of thousand galaxies you can see easily with your eye in here .
you hear about mars , it &apos;s a problem communic@@ ating to mars because it takes light long enough to go there .
so we have this picture , which is quite a spectac@@ ular picture , and i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , where we &apos;re going to have some mysteri@@ ous process that kic@@ ks the universe off at the beginning .
so there &apos;s an interesting pattern , but we don &apos;t have enough data here to actually see the pattern .
so what i &apos;m going to do is show you the distribution of matter as a function of sc@@ ales .
so a gi@@ g@@ ap@@ ar@@ se@@ c is three billion light years -- that &apos;s the scale .
that &apos;s the issue , right ?
and at that point , the universe mysteri@@ ously starts acceler@@ ating its ex@@ pan@@ sion and cu@@ ts off the forma@@ tion of lar@@ ger@@ -@@ scale structure .

and we really don &apos;t have experience with pande@@ mic@@ s , and we &apos;re also not very good as a society at acting to things we don &apos;t have direct and sort of gu@@ t-@@ level experience with .
and we can &apos;t fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we &apos;re doing , because a milli@@ on-@@ dollar act causes a billion dollars of damage , causes a trillion dollar response which is lar@@ gely in@@ effective and argu@@ ably , probably almost certainly , has made the problem worse .
the thing that we see as the kind of moore &apos;s law trend that &apos;s driving impro@@ vement in our ability to address the environmental problem is new materials .

one of the things that is just -- i almost can &apos;t con@@ cei@@ ve it -- is the idea that the national news media hasn &apos;t picked this up at all ,
you can think of the earth &apos;s bi@@ osp@@ here as a pal@@ ace , and the contin@@ ents are rooms in the pal@@ ace , and the islands are small rooms .
and if you look at projec@@ tions over the next 10 to 15 to 20 years , it looks like the world car park could grow to on the order of 1.@@ 1 billion vehic@@ les .

these were just some of the things i &apos;ve made .
in my shop where i studied , or learned , there was a traditional hier@@ arch@@ y of master , jour@@ ne@@ y@@ man and learned wor@@ ker , and app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and i worked as the app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
however , the director , the chemi@@ st , model maker -- everybody -- concerned himself much more with the art department -- that means , with my work -- than making toi@@ lets ,
so i was arre@@ sted quite early in stal@@ in &apos;s pur@@ ges , and spent 16 months in a russi@@ an prison .
and most of those los@@ ses are because of things we know .
so it means that bee@@ ke@@ e@@ pers are very good at replac@@ ing dead@@ -@@ ou@@ ts , and so they &apos;ve been able to cover those los@@ ses .
you know , they pick up their hi@@ ves ; they move their families once or twice in a year .

it &apos;s fully autom@@ ated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lif@@ ts .
i swit@@ ched lan@@ es on the high@@ way and the driver , this chap@@ er@@ one , said , &quot; you know , you were just going 1@@ 10 miles an hour . &quot;
and then i ta@@ sted it , and it , you know , had this kind of un@@ c@@ tu@@ ous , por@@ ty rich@@ ness , which is character@@ i@@ stic of that wine -- that it sort of rese@@ mb@@ les port in a lot of ways .
now , this is ber@@ n@@ ou@@ l@@ li &apos;s gift . this is a direct quote .
but in fact , there are many more words in the english language with r in the third than the first place .
when was the last time that you saw exten@@ sive intervie@@ ws with everybody who lost ?
why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no , before i &apos;d even told you anything about the context ?
would you spend your rema@@ ining 20 dollars on a tic@@ ket ?

people are being killed for no reason instead of good reason -- as if there &apos;s good reason , but sometimes people think there are .
is that what happened ?
now , i think there &apos;s many good reasons not to listen to econom@@ ists .

the cu@@ ban mis@@ s@@ ile crisis was re@@ solved in a chinese restaurant called y@@ en@@ ching pal@@ ace in washington , d@@ c ,
if you see them side by side , there &apos;s yellow and brown .
it was introduced into the united states in the 18@@ 0@@ 0s , but became pop@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed in the 19@@ 20@@ s and the 19@@ 3@@ 0s .
i like to say ch@@ op su@@ ey is the biggest cul@@ in@@ ary joke one culture ever played on another , because &quot; ch@@ op su@@ ey , &quot; translat@@ ed into chinese , means &quot; j@@ aa@@ h@@ p-@@ se@@ u@@ i , &quot; which , translat@@ ed back , means &quot; od@@ ds and ends . &quot;
who came up with the idea of ch@@ op su@@ ey ?
this is something that , in the chinese version , has no sou@@ p .
this is a sli@@ p one of the win@@ ners had ,
i was surprised to discover that not only in phil@@ a@@ del@@ phi@@ a , but also in atlan@@ ta .
it was called -- it was called &quot; the air pu@@ mp , &quot; or something like &quot; the le@@ vi@@ athan and the air pu@@ mp . &quot;
they didn &apos;t call it a vacu@@ um pu@@ mp at the time .
come here and you can meet in the building , but just don &apos;t talk about religion in there .

i may not care about the fact that it &apos;s pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from he@@ ating this solution .
there &apos;s a lot of little things involved in making a ro@@ cket that it will actually work , even after you have the fuel .
and then you figure out better and better ways to do it .
there is nothing in their contract , in fact , that makes it to their advantage always , to tell you the truth .
which would be evidence for str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening of the tro@@ pic@@ al circu@@ lation in the 199@@ 0s .

i made a de@@ sk@@ top publi@@ shing system way back when , and that was , kind of , my first step into fig@@ uring out how to -- oh , these two sides are kind of fun to mix .
i built a working version of an ado@@ be illu@@ strat@@ or@@ -@@ ish thing .
and so began to have multiple p@@ ens on the page -- again , hard to do with our hands .

and i began to wonder , is this the goal ?
very simple box@@ es : you just press one bu@@ tton and some led interaction occur@@ s .

dinos@@ au@@ r evolution proce@@ eded at a st@@ ately p@@ ace , an order of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de slo@@ wer on any way you want to measure it .
this is sort of a nice hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter ride through those early be@@ ds ,
there &apos;s no roads into the sahar@@ a . it &apos;s an enormous place .
and , you know , on and on -- a whole men@@ ag@@ erie . when you pick up something like this -- and some of you have had the chance to touch it -- this is a piece of history . you &apos;re tou@@ ching something that &apos;s 1@@ 10 million years old .
we had to try and re@@ construc@@ t this .
ps : don &apos;t get off ! don &apos;t get off ! don &apos;t get off !
we can &apos;t predict , necessarily , what will happen in evolution , but we can learn some of the rules of the game ,
and run it a thousand times , so we can estim@@ ate the para@@ meters , to answer the question whether we are on the mark or not , at least to know the barri@@ ers of the problems . so that &apos;s a little bit about the science .
we &apos;ve known that for a long time . we &apos;ve gone through the sp@@ u@@ t@@ n@@ ik pha@@ se , and now , as you see the increase in the p@@ ace of what we &apos;re doing , it becomes even more pro@@ min@@ ent . where are all these people going to come from ?
it &apos;s hard to get them to envi@@ sion themselves as a scientist ,
this led me to starting a company called design within reach , a company dealing with simple forms , making good designers available to us , and also selling the person@@ alities and character of the designers as well , and it seems to have worked .
just a piece of barri@@ er tape construction stuff in it@@ al@@ y .

and then there are your bi@@ g-@@ d design stat@@ e@@ ments : the pr@@ it@@ z@@ ker pa@@ vi@@ lion done by frank ge@@ h@@ ry .
he got a job working for ra@@ y@@ the@@ on , designing gu@@ i@@ dance systems , which was part of the route 12@@ 8 high-@@ tech ax@@ is in those days -- so the equivalent of si@@ li@@ con@@ e valley in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .

and if you move to the right you also get language , because that &apos;s abstr@@ acting even further from rese@@ mb@@ lance , but still main@@ ta@@ ining meaning .
there were hyper@@ text com@@ ics .
here &apos;s another one i &apos;ll show you . this is by dre@@ w we@@ ing ; this is called , &quot; pu@@ p con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ates the heat death of the universe . &quot; see what &apos;s going on here
and let &apos;s face it , everyone &apos;s trying to move towards whole gra@@ ins .
and so , if we can release some of those , they become ac@@ ces@@ sible to us in our pal@@ ate .
it &apos;s yea@@ st bur@@ ps and swe@@ at .
when it gets to about 1@@ 60 degrees , the prote@@ ins all line up and they create structure , the glu@@ ten structure -- what ultimately we will call the cru@@ mb of the bread .
it &apos;s just a eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m for killing , right ?
and we in@@ fu@@ se that cla@@ y with an ingredi@@ ent that we call &quot; lea@@ ven . &quot; in this case , it &apos;s yea@@ st , but yea@@ st is lea@@ ven . what does lea@@ ven mean ?
the yea@@ st , whose mission it has been up ti@@ ll now to raise the d@@ ough , to en@@ li@@ ven it , to vi@@ vi@@ fy it ,

think about meaningful places .
right ? all of those are man@@ -@@ made , artific@@ i@@ ality brought into the woo@@ ds by you , and by the very nature of being there .
and all those things make something in@@ auth@@ enti@@ c .
if you do like it , it &apos;s f@@ au@@ x .
knowing where your her@@ it@@ age is : what you have done in the past .
right ? coffee , at its core , is what ?
and that moved us to the next level .
it is the program . it is the code of life .
we are starting to understand that .
you will give your genome to the ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ ist , and your drug will be made for you and it will work much better than the ones that were --

so , don &apos;t worry about , don &apos;t stress about that stuff . we &apos;ve been doing this forever .
there are thousands of microbes there .
so , carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar , not anything .
the sc@@ op@@ e of solutions that we disc@@ u@@ ss is actually pretty bro@@ ad , but that reflec@@ ts both the range of challenges that need to be met and the kinds of innov@@ ations that will allow us to do so .
and actually , a growing number of science publi@@ sh@@ ers are adop@@ ting this model .
now , just to be clear , in this talk i &apos;m using the name &quot; earth wit@@ ness &quot; as part of the scenario , simply as a shor@@ th@@ and , for what this imagin@@ ary project could asp@@ ire to ,
it &apos;s har@@ dly a stre@@ tch to imagine putting the same thing on a phone car@@ ried by a person .
so why have i spent the bul@@ k of my time telling you about something that doesn &apos;t exist ?
so , in 2000 we wrote &quot; rare earth . &quot; in 2003 , we then asked , let &apos;s not think about where ear@@ ths are in space , but how long has earth been earth ?
well , we know from astro@@ biology that we can really now predict what &apos;s going to happen to our particular planet .
the effects of it spread this very th@@ in impact layer all over the planet , and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful am@@ mon@@ ites , le@@ con@@ te@@ ic@@ er@@ as here , and cel@@ a@@ ec@@ er@@ as over here , and so much else .
that &apos;s an 18@@ -@@ in@@ ch long sk@@ ul@@ l of an animal that was probably seven or eight feet , spra@@ w@@ led like a li@@ z@@ ard , probably had a head like a lion .
they hate we animals .
this is when deep@@ -@@ earth material comes to the surface , spre@@ ads out over the surface of the planet .
well now , i die .
do we all have to have a little bu@@ tton saying , let me die ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
they all come down to the idea of an expect@@ ation of something good that is due to happen .
i &apos;m intri@@ gu@@ ed by a concept that was brought to life in the early part of the 19@@ th century -- actually , in the second decade of the 19@@ th century -- by a 2@@ 7@@ -year-old po@@ et whose name was per@@ cy shel@@ ley .
and who no doubt will continue to succe@@ ed , as long as more and more of us en@@ list ourselves in their cause .
i call this hy@@ person@@ ic sound .
what if i could a@@ im sound the way i a@@ im light ?
and , you know , if the sound isn &apos;t there , the s@@ ale typically isn &apos;t made .
well , if i turn up the am@@ pl@@ itu@@ de too much , i &apos;m having an effect on the pressure , which means during the making of that s@@ ine wave , the speed at which it is pro@@ pag@@ ating is shif@@ ting .
i &apos;m serious . and they have these inf@@ r@@ ared devices that can look at their coun@@ ten@@ ance , from 100 y@@ ards away when they play this thing .
you &apos;ve been a great audience . i know i &apos;ve jump@@ ed all over the place .
so , why don &apos;t you tell that story ?
&quot; i want to see if i can , you know -- i need to just see if i can sit in on some of your practic@@ es , see what dr@@ ills you do and whatever . &quot;
and i , i mean , was just mor@@ ti@@ fied -- because i was signed up for the 200 , you know , which went off in a half hour .
i made the front page of my home@@ town paper that i deliver@@ ed for six years , you know ?
so they call us out and , you know -- &quot; ladies , you have one minute . &quot;
there are hair fol@@ lic@@ les on them , and i can paint my toen@@ a@@ ils .
but without having the silicon so@@ ck , i &apos;m just going to try sli@@ p in it .
and it &apos;s really an amazing store . i got them a year and two weeks ago . and this is just a silicon piece of skin .

these sequ@@ ences right up here -- which don &apos;t even code for protein , by the way -- are almost absolutely iden@@ tical across all of these ,
and so we can look at spo@@ ts .
we don &apos;t know what the sequence is ; just pull them out of the field .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
well , first of all , when you have a big chip like this , you need a little bit more informa@@ tics ,
switch antibio@@ tics : so they swit@@ ched to another antibio@@ tic , tam@@ i@@ flu . it &apos;s not clear why they thought she had the flu , but they swit@@ ched to tam@@ i@@ flu .
for maybe about 10 percent of pro@@ state cancer , there are folks that are pre@@ disp@@ os@@ ed to it .
is it a link to on@@ co@@ gen@@ es@@ is ? i don &apos;t know .
and its orig@@ ins come from sco@@ t@@ land with the music and all the tradi@@ tions , the dan@@ cing , the language , which unfortunately is dying out in cape bre@@ ton .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
well , it &apos;s just so interesting that don@@ nel@@ l &apos;s up@@ bringing was very similar to mine , and i actually saw don@@ nel@@ l play when i was about 12 years old ,
d@@ l : with one minute .
anyway , i &apos;m bla@@ b@@ ber@@ ing on here .
right when i was 15 was when i first got interested in solar energy .
and then i started ide@@ al@@ ab
you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a pure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at gu@@ ess@@ ing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mu@@ tations -- and you use natural selec@@ tion to kill off not as good solutions .
now that we have concentr@@ ated sun@@ light , what are we going to put at the center to conver@@ t sun@@ light to electricity ?
the other thing we discovered is that efficiency doesn &apos;t matter so much if your energy source is free .
we got the results from that for the opti@@ mal engine .
you don &apos;t have to tell what ori@@ en@@ tation .
it turns out there &apos;s a lot of powerful sun all around the world , obviously , but in special places where it happens to be relatively in@@ expensive to place these and also in many more places where there is high wind power .
so there &apos;s basically 15 hor@@ ses running at full speed just to keep the stage l@@ it .
and part of the reason i feel that way is looking at the past .
a terrible disease . it was in the united states . it was in europe .
there &apos;s no reason only poor people should have the experience .
we need rich@@ -@@ world governments to be very gener@@ ous in provi@@ ding aid for these things .
because they weren &apos;t tracking where the kids were before that .
but i can tell you that absolutely is not happening today .
now , there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made .
even a teacher who wants to improve doesn &apos;t have the tools to do it .
but i -- i &apos;m optimi@@ stic .
once i realized that i could take some liber@@ ties with the subject , i did the following series of dra@@ wings .
i do a lot of work for the school of visual arts , where i teach ,
and i was going to do a thing , i say , &quot; well , change the copy . let it say something about dreams , and come to s@@ va and you &apos;ll sort of ful@@ fill your dreams . &quot;
this could be embar@@ ra@@ ssing .
so i worked very hard on this .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and char@@ l@@ ene told them about how she ignor@@ ed her super@@ vis@@ or &apos;s ad@@ mon@@ i@@ tion and didn &apos;t vacu@@ um the vis@@ it@@ or &apos;s l@@ oun@@ ge because there were some family members who were there all day , every day who , at this moment , happened to be taking a na@@ p .
the good news is you don &apos;t need to be brilliant to be wise .
when things go wrong , as of course they do , we reach for two tools to try to fix them .
all over chicago in every kinder@@ gar@@ ten class in the city , every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day .
but it had to go somewhere and they had respon@@ si@@ bilities as citizens .
what to do instead ?
i &apos;m bo@@ gg@@ led at how much he and his associ@@ ates needed to know in order to p@@ lot this out .
they need to learn to respect their school@@ mates .

and your friend@@ ly citi@@ bank had 47 times .
this stuff is getting serious enough that if we don &apos;t start paying attention to the de@@ fic@@ it , we &apos;re going to end up losing the dollar .

and that &apos;s where these three trends come together .
so you take res@@ ver@@ at@@ rol and you put it into beer .

which is why the robot &apos;s we &apos;re designing today are a little different .
but , in 10 or 15 machine generations they will , and these are machine generations , not human generations .
maybe not .
because the re@@ he@@ ar@@ s@@ al meant a great challenge to me .

because we could do a whole ted@@ talk on the next several sli@@ des .

among the other interesting things that have cro@@ pped up are many things from businesses , from marketing and communic@@ ations and pre@@ dict@@ able things , to an in@@ san@@ ely popular kore@@ an-@@ bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e tac@@ o truck that drives around l@@ .@@ a. and twit@@ ters where it stop@@ s , cau@@ sing a line to form around the block .
this not only lets you view twit@@ ters in different ways , but it introduc@@ es new use cases as well .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any other way of getting inst@@ ant feedback that way .
so david and i decided to go find out , through the best research we could mu@@ ster , what it would take to get a little girl to put her hands on a computer , to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology that little boys have because they play video games .
so , we &apos;re real , and we &apos;ve tou@@ ched several hundreds of thousands of little girls .
girl 8 : well , sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on because i have music lessons and i &apos;m on swi@@ m team -- all this different stuff that i have to do , and sometimes it gets over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
b@@ l : ok , so we &apos;re going to emo@@ tionally navi@@ gate . if we were playing the game , that &apos;s what we &apos;d do .
there was a very sick oran@@ gu@@ tan baby , my first encoun@@ ter .
in 200@@ 2 we had about 50 percent of the people jo@@ b@@ less there .
so we do the &quot; people , profit , planet &quot; principles , but we do it in addition to a sure legal status -- because if the forest belon@@ gs to the state , people say , &quot; it belon@@ gs to me , it belon@@ gs to everyone . &quot;
ap@@ ri@@ l .
what i really did was i just followed nature , and nature doesn &apos;t know mon@@ o@@ cultures , but a natural forest is multi@@ la@@ y@@ ered . that means that both in the ground and above the ground it can make better use of the available light , it can store more carbon in the system , it can provide more func@@ tions . but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
on the top left , underneath those green stri@@ p@@ es , you see some white dots -- those are actually individual p@@ ine@@ apple plants that you can see from space .
in the tro@@ pic@@ s , rain@@ dro@@ ps are not formed from ice cr@@ y@@ st@@ als , which is the case in the temper@@ ate zones ,
and they can start producing from the trees as many as they like .
n@@ al@@ in@@ i n@@ ad@@ kar@@ n@@ i : con@@ ser@@ ving the can@@ op@@ y
these plants oc@@ c@@ ur in great diversity , over 28@@ ,000 species around the world .
i &apos;ve also looked out on urban places like this and thought about people who are dis@@ associated from trees in their lives .
he saw ne@@ sts in the can@@ op@@ y at one of our can@@ op@@ y conf@@ lu@@ ences in the pacific nor@@ th@@ west , and created this beautiful sculp@@ ture .
well , my thought was that i could learn how to grow mos@@ ses , and that way we wouldn &apos;t have to take them out of the wild .
so , although it &apos;s a little bit of a fan@@ tas@@ y , i think it &apos;s also a reality .
we go to cra@@ ig and we check in to a hotel
mel@@ an@@ ie pic@@ ks up the lam@@ b -- two hands --

the te@@ stic@@ les emer@@ ge -- they look like thu@@ mb@@ s , coming right at you --
an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is is the gre@@ ek word for discovery .
because , look , i &apos;m not a social anthrop@@ ologist but i have a friend who is .
so i started to wonder what would happen if we challen@@ ged some of these sac@@ red co@@ ws .
if he could use it to make these bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able flo@@ wer po@@ ts .
so , i &apos;m 40 feet off the de@@ ck ,
and we didn &apos;t t@@ wist our mu@@ sta@@ che in some mach@@ i@@ a@@ vel@@ li@@ an way , but we &apos;ve done it .
and nobody celebr@@ ates im@@ itation the way &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; guys know it has to be done .
and i know the point of this conference is to celebr@@ ate things that are near and de@@ ar to us ,
my new life is trying to understand what beauty is about , and &quot; pretty , &quot; and &quot; emotions . &quot;
yeah ! yeah .
so , imagine i have a plan@@ k about two feet wide and 30 feet long and i &apos;m going to walk on it , and you see i can walk on it without looking , i can go back and forth and i can jump up and down .
and when you &apos;re happy -- what we call positive val@@ ence -- you squ@@ ir@@ t dop@@ am@@ ine into the pre@@ front@@ al lo@@ bes , which makes you a bre@@ ad@@ th-@@ first problem sol@@ ver :
and when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
and that means the te@@ a is parti@@ ally covered while it comple@@ tes the bre@@ wing .
but that &apos;s reflec@@ tive design as well .
but i would say no .
he can ask for addi@@ tional information .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
so this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer peter sa@@ ville , went to fashion designer alex@@ ander mc@@ queen , and photo@@ grapher ni@@ ck k@@ night , who were also interested in explor@@ ing that conversation .
and i can change my he@@ ight --
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1020352 &quot; &gt; thu-huong ha &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and something very unusual happens .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ ce@@ ph@@ alo@@ gram , the right brain of each of them becomes at@@ tun@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of this ear@@ liest of play scen@@ es and the phy@@ si@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an an@@ atom@@ ically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
try and imagine a culture or a life , adult or otherwise without play .
found that when he looked at a play@@ ground out of a window into which he had been con@@ fin@@ ed , he felt something different .
and one of their projects was to see what makes meet@@ ings bor@@ ing , and to try and do something about it .
and this is where my ch@@ as@@ ing animals for four , five years really changed my perspective from a clin@@ ici@@ an to what i am now , which is that play has a biological place , just like sleep and dreams do .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : 20 years ago , tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee invented the world wide web . for his next project , he &apos;s building a web for open , lin@@ ked data that could do for numbers what the web did for words , pictures , video : un@@ lock our data and re@@ frame the way we use it together .
i can show somebody a piece of hyper@@ text , a page which has got links , and we click on the link and bing -- there &apos;ll be another hyper@@ text page .
who was here or has otherwise seen hans ros@@ ling &apos;s talk ?
data is relationships .
this is just the gra@@ ss@@ roots stuff again , ok ?
audience : ra@@ w .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
that &apos;s how lin@@ ked data works .
i ’ m going around the world giving talks about darwin ,
you have to look in our brains to understand why they ’ re s@@ weet .
it ’ s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , me@@ ss@@ y di@@ ap@@ ers .
dan ari@@ ely : our bu@@ g@@ gy moral code
or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
other people i would tempt to che@@ at .
we call this like a personal fu@@ dge factor .
we did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
will they che@@ at more , or will they che@@ at less ?
you call them stock , or stock op@@ tions , der@@ i@@ v@@ atives , mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge-@@ bac@@ ked se@@ curi@@ ties .
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nur@@ ses would have been willing to check their intui@@ tion , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more syste@@ matic experimen@@ tation of our intui@@ tions .
and i found lots of refer@@ ence material , lots of lo@@ vely pictures . no di@@ ce : no do@@ do skelet@@ on for me . but the damage had been done .
i actually understood the mechan@@ ics of ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e enough to kind of start to im@@ it@@ ate them .
and so now it was time to do some research .
so i was able to actually scre@@ en-@@ shot and free@@ ze@@ -@@ frame to make sure .
like it is in the movie .

this is popular work@@ ben@@ ch . popular science magaz@@ ines in those days -- i had a huge collection of them from the &apos; 3@@ 0s --
this is tank pol@@ o in the south ha@@ mp@@ tons .
i did that as a quick back page -- i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lam@@ p@@ oon , and i did that , and i thought , &quot; well , i &apos;m as@@ ha@@ med . i hope nobody knows it . &quot;
people always ask me , where do you get your ideas , how do your ideas come ?
we &apos;ve also found that you can reduce the fresh air requi@@ re@@ ments into the building , while main@@ ta@@ ining industry in@@ door air@@ -@@ quality stand@@ ards .
40 percent of the world &apos;s energy is taken up by buildings currently , and 60 percent of the world &apos;s population will be living in buildings in cities with a population of over one million in the next 15 years .
so this is of course or@@ ville and wil@@ bu@@ r w@@ right , and the w@@ right fl@@ yer .
so we &apos;re beyond the 12@@ -@@ second steps .
jac@@ qu@@ el@@ ine no@@ vo@@ grat@@ z : an es@@ cape from poverty
i was struc@@ k immediately by the kin@@ dness and the gent@@ len@@ ess in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
and so she can &apos;t move out .
it &apos;s an opportunity to truly build a world where we can ex@@ tend services and products to all human beings , so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .
now , it works just like a regular phone .
and it &apos;s so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it .
this is me with a cam@@ cor@@ der on a phone going like this .
right ? nobody knows you &apos;re in pakistan .
like you can say , i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours .
these are all the different things that you can text to google and they will -- yeah ! you &apos;re all trying to write this down .
google : hold on .
that &apos;s who can afford to do that .
there are these services that transcri@@ be your vo@@ ic@@ email into text .
so it had better be the gist of the gist , right ?
phone : well , i don &apos;t know if you heard , you might have heard from len@@ ny , but -- i think the biggest change when internet met phone was with the iphone .
it &apos;s ab@@ sur@@ d . we have power out@@ lets in every room of every building . we have running water .
it will immediately play you that song or that band .
sorry , that was mean .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
so during the last 15 years , i &apos;ve been working to actually study the earlier interface here -- what i &apos;ve la@@ bel@@ ed &quot; vir@@ al ch@@ at@@ ter , &quot; which was a term co@@ ined by my men@@ tor don bur@@ ke .
the animals are simply gone .
now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoul@@ der -- this is the individual that hun@@ ted the mon@@ key from the last picture that i showed you .
and this was somebody who had incredible potential to spread aspec@@ ts of our message , whether it be with re@@ gar@@ ds to wild@@ life conservation or health preven@@ tion .
so , once we discovered that it was really possible that we could actually do this monit@@ or@@ ing , we decided to move this from research , to really at@@ tempt to pha@@ se up to a global monit@@ or@@ ing effort .

in those long-@@ ago days , women , my mother , my friends &apos; mothers , our neighbors , all the women i knew -- wor@@ e , often much of the day , what were called house@@ dre@@ sses , cheap , prin@@ ted , pul@@ p@@ y , seem@@ ingly pur@@ pos@@ efully shap@@ eless light co@@ tton shif@@ ts that you wor@@ e over your ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn and , when you had to go look for a child , hang wa@@ sh on the line , or run down to the gro@@ cer@@ y store on the corner , under a co@@ at ,

we@@ igh@@ t@@ fully upon me was the world .
what car@@ n@@ al mi@@ stru@@ st had their teacher taught them .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i decided to be -- to work for them as an art director .
and design is responsible for this experience .
why am i asking all of these business questions , instead of just showing them pages ?
i started with par@@ ag@@ li@@ ding .
base jump@@ ing is sky@@ di@@ ving from fix@@ ed objects , like buildings , an@@ ten@@ na@@ e , bri@@ d@@ ges and earth -- meaning mountains , cli@@ ff@@ s .
enjoy , and thank you very much .
because i just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face s@@ mu@@ shed back@@ wards .
so i can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if i can optimi@@ ze it in its most ide@@ ali@@ stic fashion .
that &apos;s the tra@@ il@@ er , pretty much finished .
and there it is , that &apos;s the bam@@ bi 16 .
that scene sounds like science fiction , but is bat@@ t@@ le@@ field reality already .
like the invention of the atom@@ ic bom@@ b .
first is , you &apos;re going to re@@ in@@ force the power of individuals against governments ,
an email that had an atta@@ ch@@ ment of video of a predat@@ or stri@@ ke taking out an ene@@ my site . mis@@ s@@ ile hits , bodies bur@@ st into the air with the expl@@ osi@@ on .
and then you get in the car and you drive home and within 20 minutes , you &apos;re sitting at the dinner table talking to your kids about their home@@ work . &quot;
we &apos;ve already had three in@@ stances of predat@@ or dr@@ one stri@@ kes where we thought we got bin laden , and it turned out not to be the case .
and so that points to the fact that our machines can be used for both good and evil , but for me it points to the fact that there &apos;s a du@@ ality of humans as well .
it &apos;s not the way they oc@@ c@@ ur in the film ,
richard sau@@ l w@@ ur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at pen@@ n .
n@@ k : yeah . no not lou@@ is far@@ ra@@ k@@ han , lou@@ is ka@@ h@@ n .
but i think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that &apos;s why , he has given love for us .
i engage in the use of game theory , game theory is a bran@@ ch of mathematics and that means , sorry , that even in the study of politics , math has come into the picture .
if we &apos;re talking about national security problems , maybe it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of state , maybe it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of defen@@ se , the director of national intelligence , maybe the am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or to the united nations , or somebody else who they think is going to know more about the particular problem .
they can keep this information straight and that means that we can process the information .

it would achieve some national pri@@ de , but not go ahead and build a weap@@ on .
two things to notice : he &apos;s getting wea@@ ker , and while he gets a lot of attention in the united states , he is not a major player in iran .
bb@@ m : well , people of iran , this is what many of you are going to evol@@ ve to want , and we could get there a lot soon@@ er , and you would suff@@ er a lot less trouble from economic san@@ c@@ tions ,
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacter@@ ial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primi@@ tive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squ@@ id wants it .
but the ri@@ ght-@@ hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
once we got that far , we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .
it gets in , it starts growing , it starts secre@@ ting its qu@@ or@@ um sen@@ sing molecules .
so , we &apos;ve tar@@ ge@@ ted those systems to make the molecules work better .
i thought nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm meant you loved yourself .

that &apos;s the other way that humor -- like art bu@@ ch@@ wal@@ d takes sho@@ ts at the heads of state .
i was so fascin@@ ated by that oxygen commercial .
&quot; for s@@ ale : white tra@@ sh comp@@ actor . &quot; so this whole subjec@@ t-@@ object thing has rel@@ evan@@ ce to humor in this way .
and it was like being psycho@@ analy@@ zed .

how do you do it from the power of the consumer up ?
and you can go again .
and the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number .
who told me , if you can find the money you need for this network , 200 million dollars , and if you can find a car company that will build that car in mass volume , in two million cars -- that &apos;s what we needed in israel --
if you fail the i@@ q test they ask you to leave the country .
it becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out .
that is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world .
we for@@ got about the entire chain around us .
we have to start thinking about giving kic@@ kers to countries that are willing to go to this kind of scale .
we have to make the right moral decision .
we &apos;re biological creatures .
well , it will really mean preci@@ ous little .
but in five to ten years we &apos;re going to start see some very profound changes .
it would change absolutely everything .
and pretty soon it &apos;s going to be possible to avoid vir@@ tually all genetic diseases in that way .
that &apos;s really the central one , i believe .
and that &apos;s where about half of our drugs come .
and what &apos;s extraordinary is that we &apos;re not just obser@@ ving this , we are the architec@@ ts of this .
imagine if a group of sculp@@ tors could be inside of a lat@@ ti@@ ce of atoms and scul@@ pt with their material .
these gener@@ ative algorithms grow over time , and they interact and communicate as a s@@ warm of insects .
as the sound starts to pul@@ se and contract , our physici@@ sts can tell when a pho@@ ton is going to be em@@ it@@ ted .
and this rou@@ t@@ ine went on for some time .
and that &apos;s what i want everyone in here to feel like , the incredible hul@@ k , at the end of this presen@@ tation .
the problem is hydro@@ dynam@@ ics .
below is what most swi@@ mmers will find enab@@ les them to do what i did , which is going from 21 stro@@ kes per 20@@ -@@ y@@ ard l@@ ength to 11 stro@@ kes in two work@@ ou@@ ts with no co@@ ach , no video monit@@ or@@ ing .
so , but i didn &apos;t say . i said , . pretty close .
and have continu@@ ed to apply this material over method approach to close to a dozen languages now .
she comes up , and this was her approach , the teacher .
these seemed to be the three areas that i could explo@@ it to compe@@ te if i wanted to comp@@ te@@ te against people who &apos;d been practic@@ ing for 20 to 30 years .

but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are cro@@ che@@ ting it because many organisms in coral re@@ efs have a very particular kind of structure .
so here we have a line and a point outside the line .
does anyone want to guess what it is ?
and you can st@@ it@@ ch all sorts of mathematical the@@ or@@ em@@ s onto these sur@@ faces .

and i fle@@ w it .

would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their ta@@ il@@ bone ?
and there is a variety of other things : the shape of the c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons , the gel we put .
but there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
in lou@@ i@@ si@@ ana , about one in five white vo@@ ters said , &quot; yes , one of the big reasons why i vo@@ ted against bar@@ ack obama is because he was an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american . &quot;
so yes , rac@@ ism is pre@@ dict@@ able .
and li@@ ke@@ wise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 199@@ 6 , &quot; would you not vote for a qu@@ ali@@ fied black president ? &quot;
but the point is , this is all good news ,
and so there is a team of develop@@ ers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from mal@@ aw@@ i , from kenya .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
these are , most of these are from a mon@@ th@@ ly page i do in and architecture and design magazine called me@@ tro@@ pol@@ is .
adults find it comfor@@ ting .
that &apos;s the end .
the profound con@@ volu@@ tions on the surface of a dri@@ ed ch@@ er@@ ry .
and they thre@@ w up walls -- political walls , trade walls , transpor@@ tation walls , communication walls , i@@ ron cur@@ tains -- which divi@@ ded peop@@ les and nations .
in@@ comes at that time less than $ 1,000 per year .
this provi@@ des a reason why trade and glob@@ alization are even more important , more powerful than ever before , and are going to increase growth more than ever before .
so the market for those movies is larger .
now we &apos;re not there yet .

it &apos;s a very simple experiment where a mon@@ key has been trained in a task that invol@@ ves it manipul@@ ating a tool
we see that the mon@@ key has actually changed the fil@@ ter character@@ ist@@ ics which represents input from the skin of the fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps that are engaged .
it &apos;s what &apos;s re@@ war@@ ding to you .
and i &apos;m going to talk about experiments that invol@@ ve actually using this brain science ,
it &apos;s mu@@ ff@@ led english . it &apos;s de@@ gra@@ ded japanese .
changing it in detail . it takes about 30 hours on the average .
just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning , it &apos;s going back into chaos in the end .

the whole immun@@ e system s@@ war@@ ms into the lun@@ gs .
so what i started thinking was , perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here .
why should a conflict like iraq have this as its fundamental sig@@ nature ?
so we look at a process of group dynam@@ ics : co@@ al@@ es@@ c@@ ence and frag@@ men@@ tation ,
they &apos;re more robu@@ st ; there is less groups ;

fran@@ tz fan@@ on , who was a psychiatri@@ st from mar@@ tin@@ i@@ que , said , &quot; each generation must , out of rel@@ ative ob@@ sc@@ ur@@ ity , discover its mission , and ful@@ fill or be@@ tra@@ y it . &quot;
we thought everyone could participate .
and folks asked me , &quot; why did you take up what you took up ? &quot;
human creativity . it &apos;s our at@@ tempt as humans to build an understanding of the universe , the world around us .
and folks say we need to choose either or .
another thing they talked about was the infrastructure that suppor@@ ts the sci@@ ences
to tell you really quickly what i &apos;m doing .

the br@@ onze is nice hard , du@@ ra@@ ble material that could roll on the ground .
this is in a sculp@@ ture park in ta@@ e@@ j@@ on .
it was a diam@@ ond cell structure was the point of de@@ par@@ ture .
this has evolved over the years in a lot of different it@@ er@@ ations .
but then one could interact with that and show plate te@@ ct@@ on@@ ics or global warming issues , or migra@@ tions -- all of the things that we &apos;re concerned with today .
so i &apos;m going to ba@@ ke bread for you .
it was a my@@ th@@ ical past .
and the world population in the mean@@ time has doub@@ led .
and also a source of moder@@ n@@ ity , of modern life .
we rel@@ eg@@ ate them to poverty .
so what can we do ?
there are different ways in which we must use it -- for resi@@ den@@ tial , for nature , for agriculture pur@@ poses .
and the kind of simp@@ li@@ stic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not mor@@ ally ju@@ sti@@ fied .

what we &apos;ve done as sp@@ am@@ mers is tried to hy@@ p@@ noti@@ ze everyone into buying our idea ,
people i know who are fire@@ men told me that this is not un@@ common .
it &apos;s easy to look at what i &apos;ve said so far , and say , &quot; wait a minute , i don &apos;t have what it takes to be that kind of leader . &quot;
hu@@ go cha@@ ve@@ z did not invent the disa@@ ff@@ ec@@ ted middle and lower class of ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela . he mer@@ ely led them .
mi@@ chel@@ le k@@ au@@ f@@ man has pion@@ eer@@ ed new ways of thinking about environmental architecture .
you don &apos;t need per@@ mission from people to lead them .
so i &apos;d like you to do something for me .
now , what has happened ?
so there &apos;s some problem with these me@@ tric@@ s now .
and there &apos;s good studies of the refuge@@ es coming out of congo -- they have two , three percent infected , and peac@@ eful z@@ ambi@@ a -- much higher .
look , the highly infected are four percent of all population
vo@@ d@@ ka -- and it goes on like this , you know ?
♫ we &apos;re ready to fly ! ♫ thank you very much .
now in india &apos;s case i believe there are six ideas which are responsible for where it has come today .
the third big thing i believe that has changed india is our at@@ titude towards the english language .
and therefore democracy has become em@@ bed@@ ded .
but today , finally , after economic re@@ forms , and economic growth , i think the notion that cities are eng@@ ines of economic growth , cities are eng@@ ines of creativity , cities are eng@@ ines of innovation , have finally been accep@@ ted .
it &apos;s very difficult to start a private university .
number one , this matters because this represents more than a billion people .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest cul@@ pr@@ it in this massive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the earth by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bi@@ osp@@ here .
in a land@@ fill or an in@@ cin@@ er@@ ator --
thinking it through , i realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move t to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
we call it cool car@@ p@@ et .
what else is there ?
and now the challenge is in execu@@ tion .
and through his so@@ ber@@ ing point of view i saw a day that you would see , a day for you but not for me .
and i came up with an idea that i would write a coo@@ k@@ book .
i will tell you a little bit about ir@@ rational behavior , and i want to start by giving you some examples of visual illu@@ sion as a metaphor for ra@@ tion@@ ality .
if i cover the rest of the cu@@ be , you can see that they are iden@@ tical .
and countries on the left that seem to giving very little , or much less .
we wake up in the morning and we open the clos@@ et ; we feel that we decide what to wear .
and they took a group of physici@@ ans . they presen@@ ted to them a case study of a patient .
but the moment you set this as the de@@ fa@@ ult , it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing .
and they passed me from one person to another to another ,
if we &apos;re attrac@@ ted or not .
in fact , in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
so it would have been moving images .
and she said , &quot; yeah , but you know i &apos;d rather finish my me@@ al if you don &apos;t mind . &quot;
you know ? you can get ca@@ da@@ vers if you work at a university . &quot;
and appar@@ ently the ro@@ y@@ al court physici@@ an said to her , &quot; i am of the opini@@ on that the vul@@ va of your most sac@@ red maj@@ est@@ y be ti@@ til@@ lat@@ ed for some time pri@@ or to inter@@ course . &quot;

i never cut class . sorry , i don &apos;t know if anybody is cu@@ tting class .
and i hope in pur@@ su@@ ing your dreams , you all remain re@@ solu@@ te , that you go forward without lim@@ its , and that you use your tal@@ ents -- because there are many ; we &apos;ve seen them ;
and they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet with people like us .
and then they go away and plan exactly how they &apos;re going to collect these se@@ eds . they have thousands of people all over the world ta@@ gging places where those plants are said to exist . they search for them . they find them in flo@@ wer .
these are not just cro@@ p plants , as you might have seen stor@@ ed in s@@ val@@ b@@ ard in nor@@ way --

the amount of dna data we &apos;ve sequ@@ enced has doub@@ led every year .
and we &apos;re only eight dou@@ bl@@ ings away from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs .
then we are going to apply them to the other areas , like energy , ec@@ ology , policy law and eth@@ ics , entreprene@@ ur@@ ship , so that people can bring these new technologies to the world .

so what are we waiting for ?
this was my mental model of the world :
but i think we &apos;re in for another change ,
and when you look at the worldwide sources of co2 , 5@@ 2 percent are ti@@ ed to buildings .
and they are so excited . that &apos;s the first board off the line .
last but not least , bill gates , i know you invented windows .
so we considered all of this . and we realized that electrical app@@ li@@ an@@ ces must be able to communicate directly with the power recep@@ tac@@ le itself .

back in the mid@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s when we were designing bi@@ osp@@ here 2 , we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions .
so , on the top , we had these beautiful rain@@ forests and an ocean ,
we were taking their biom@@ as@@ s , stor@@ ing them in the base@@ ment , growing plants , going around , around , around , trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere .
yes . in a sense it was terri@@ fying .
and i reco@@ iled . they st@@ ank !
which is going to be pretty fun .
when i &apos;m model@@ ing a plant in a box , literally , i know where to draw the bound@@ ary .

but also to help en@@ sure the san@@ c@@ tity of the vote over@@ all .
slow , tex@@ t-@@ based convers@@ ations ,
this thing that looks like a peac@@ o@@ ck hit a wind@@ screen
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
last may , china in the si@@ chu@@ an pro@@ vin@@ ce
even the government learned of the earth@@ qua@@ ke from their own citizens ,
and so they started , the citi@@ zen journali@@ sts started
it comes in relatively spar@@ se ch@@ un@@ ks ,
they also affect people who want to send messages ,
because there is a lot more am@@ ate@@ urs than profession@@ als ,
on american pers@@ ons .
but not to control their suppor@@ ters .

and we would come in and talk to them , usually for about a week .
and how i &apos;ve come to view what happened to me is a vir@@ al , me@@ me@@ tic infec@@ tion .
and so the first step is to realize that we can do this together , and that there is no &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot;
he &apos;s got some sei@@ z@@ ure dis@@ order . and you don &apos;t understand this .
and so here you see him doing a li@@ tho@@ tom@@ y .
you could now start doing surgery everywhere , on the gu@@ t , on the li@@ ver , on the heart , on the brain .
sur@@ ge@@ ons had to give up their 3d vision .
so , smar@@ ty@@ pants , why isn &apos;t all surgery being done this way ? &quot;
or , not so co@@ inci@@ den@@ tally , like a tube like this .
and we can take special cameras , and we can look at it .
and the pros@@ pe@@ ct i &apos;m off@@ ering you , of an easier surgery ...
&quot; one b@@ ite , adam . don &apos;t ab@@ and@@ on eve . &quot;
and the problem is that they can become bi@@ ased ,
developing the mental flexi@@ bility to shift time perspec@@ tives flu@@ id@@ ly depen@@ ding on the dem@@ ands of the situation , that &apos;s what you &apos;ve got to learn to do .
so i want to end by saying : many of life &apos;s puzz@@ les can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others .
that will produce a le@@ giti@@ mate and accoun@@ table government .
so that is what you get when you face reality .
one is it &apos;s got to do economic re@@ form , not fu@@ ss about the political constitu@@ tion .
typical post-@@ conflict situation is a zo@@ o of different ac@@ tors with different pri@@ orities .
it &apos;s not sustainable .
so we need to encourage the growth of local fir@@ ms .
they would be co-@@ brand@@ ed as being done by the post-@@ conflict government , in the country .
because there wouldn &apos;t be any money in taking part in the politics .
i &apos;ve been following this change for quite a while now , and particip@@ ating in it .
and this challenges yet another assump@@ tion ,
not out of the question --
and that &apos;s where my imag@@ ined future comes in ,
what is the story you most want for them to tell ?
because the south pole is at 10,000 feet ,
where do you sleep ? we sle@@ pt in a tent that was very low to the ground ,
can you imagine ? seriously , can you imagine ?
on the other hand , statistics -- that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
we &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
and the things that they build ama@@ ze even themselves .
there is a picture of charles . so let &apos;s watch the next clip .
i think one of the things i am passionate about , my grand@@ parents work ,
but you know the object is just a pi@@ vo@@ t .
the house is 19@@ 49 .
e@@ .@@ o@@ . wil@@ son once told me that when he looked at ants -- he loved them , of course , and he wanted to learn more about them -- he consci@@ ously looked at them from the stand@@ point of scale .
da@@ wn , very good . also rode on one . i ... audience : you had , i hope you had -- ed : now you &apos;ve been to the website dogs of sa@@ int lou@@ is in the late , in the mid-@@ 19@@ 30 &apos;s , then you &apos;d know that was a great dan@@ e .
we had the spel@@ ling bee in con@@ jun@@ ction with the g@@ w@@ ome@@ us club .
so my point is that this sc@@ op@@ e of vision , this ho@@ li@@ stic vision of design , was with them from the beginning .
and i really think that &apos;s where we are .
so this year we &apos;re going to visu@@ alize how the brain visu@@ ali@@ zes .
so the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways .
what we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strate@@ gic plan on one giant wall .
&lt; speaker &gt; sop@@ ha@@ l ear &lt; / speaker &gt;
the k@@ h@@ mer rou@@ ge didn &apos;t believe in money .
and it wasn &apos;t until she met a viet@@ na@@ me@@ se lady who told her this , and then tu@@ tor@@ ed her for two days inten@@ si@@ vely , that she was able to go into her ex@@ am
&lt; speaker &gt; k@@ ary mul@@ l@@ is &lt; / speaker &gt;
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
you &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line --
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent , per capit@@ a . and we are putting out less green@@ house gas@@ ses than any other state .
they are poor , but they are inten@@ sel@@ y urban . and they are inten@@ sel@@ y creative .
and you go to a nice dense place like this slu@@ m in mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i .
so one thing sl@@ am@@ med up against another , such as in sa@@ o pa@@ ul@@ o here .
very interesting side effect here ,
so with hy@@ dr@@ o ma@@ x@@ ed out ,
these things are way smaller . they &apos;re much more adap@@ table .
and bio@@ tech is moving rapidly in africa , at last .
here is an example that cli@@ mat@@ ologists like a lot ,
in the studio we do a lot of experiments .
with such a big space , the problem is obviously that there is a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy between what your body can embr@@ ace , and what the space , in that sense , is .
it was really about showing people , in this city , as they walk by , that space has dimensions . a space has time .
if you stand still , the landscape doesn &apos;t necessarily tell you how big it is .
what does the word &quot; public &quot; mean today anyway ?
and bone mar@@ row is actually what we use to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients , most of whom have advanced m@@ ali@@ g@@ nan@@ cies like leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a and ly@@ mp@@ hom@@ a and some other diseases .
we can do multiple pas@@ ses through that same en@@ try .
it may even en@@ able you to bank your own mar@@ row stem cells , when you &apos;re youn@@ ger and health@@ ier , to use in the future should you need it .
and what came up was a number of pieces of data .

when people ask you , &quot; what is the evidence for evolution ? &quot;
ted talk subtitles and transcript : we &apos;re at a unique moment in history , says uk prime minister gor@@ don brown : we can use today &apos;s inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness to develop our shared global eth@@ ic -- and work together to confron@@ t the challenges of poverty , security , climate change and the economy .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
and nelson mand@@ ela was quite surprised at the appe@@ ar@@ ance of the sing@@ er and i was expla@@ ining to him at the time who she was .
i have just been talking to the president of sier@@ ra le@@ one .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for peac@@ e@@ keeping and human@@ itarian aid , but also for re@@ construction and security for some of the conflic@@ t-@@ ri@@ dden states of the world .
one of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surr@@ ounded by sno@@ bs .
we are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
there &apos;s a real cor@@ rel@@ ation between a society that tells people that they can do anything , and the existence of low self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em .
this idea that everybody deser@@ ves to get where they get to ,
if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve me@@ ssed up their lives .
it would be in@@ san@@ e to call ham@@ let a los@@ er .
but as i get older , i &apos;m also very nu@@ an@@ ced about what that word &quot; success &quot; might mean .
let &apos;s make sure our ideas of success are truly our own .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
so i write software . and that &apos;s how i do it .
so the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light . and as you do , you see the sha@@ dows of your own speech .
it &apos;s a really profound amount of non@@ verb@@ al information that &apos;s communic@@ ated with the eyes .
so each person is looking at the looking of everyone else before them .
that &apos;s why its other name is dou@@ ble@@ ta@@ ker , ta@@ ker of doub@@ les .
and all over the world , em@@ in@@ ent evolution@@ ists are an@@ xi@@ ous to celebr@@ ate this .
but then , in the &apos; 9@@ 0s , something began to un@@ ra@@ vel .
he said what scientists do when a paradig@@ m fa@@ ils is , guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened .
you must never do that again . &quot;
and take bi@@ pe@@ d@@ ality .
pur@@ ely has to do with its conscious control of its breath .
everybody i talk to says it &apos;s ru@@ bb@@ ish .
darwin &apos;s ideas and men@@ del &apos;s ideas bl@@ ending together .
but you know , that makes me feel good ,
what kinds of rules ?
now , you won &apos;t be surprised to learn that the rules in north korea keep people there in the dark .
growth took off in china . the chinese started cat@@ ching up very quickly with the united states .
so the pro@@ pos@@ al is that we con@@ cei@@ ve of something called a char@@ ter city .
the thing that was bad about colon@@ i@@ alism , and the thing which is resi@@ du@@ ally bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on and con@@ de@@ scen@@ sion .
perhaps even in some ar@@ ran@@ gement that &apos;s a little bit like an es@@ c@@ row account , where you put land in the es@@ c@@ row account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it .
how would we finance this ?
ted talk subtitles and transcript : wil@@ l@@ ard wi@@ gan tells the story of how a difficult and lon@@ ely childhood dro@@ ve him to discover his unique ability -- to create art so tiny that it can &apos;t be seen with the na@@ ked eye . his sli@@ de@@ show of figu@@ res , as seen through a micros@@ cope , can only be described as min@@ d-@@ bo@@ gg@@ ling .
so i told her .
it became part of me .
so i got the ted@@ dy bear and i said , &quot; do you mind if i pull out one of your fi@@ bers ? &quot;
so i &apos;m thinking , &quot; mr. hu@@ f isn &apos;t going to be very happy when i told him his house has gone to another , into the atmosphere somewhere . &quot;
and put it underneath the micros@@ cope .
so what i decided to do is to plu@@ ck fine hair out of my face .
and what i normally do is walk &apos; round a room -- -- trying to find one . and then i put it underneath the micros@@ cope .
i used a micros@@ cop@@ ic sh@@ ard of diam@@ ond to actually car@@ ve the actual base .
and that &apos;s 24@@ -@@ kar@@ at gold . and it &apos;s construc@@ ted . i built it .
what if it was from a source like this ?
however , after a few failed proto@@ types , i finally came up with this , the life@@ sa@@ ver bottle .
so we &apos;re just going to put that in there as well .
so let &apos;s look at the applic@@ ations .
about half a cent a day to run .
this is what i would tell you to remember if you ever forget this again .
and like , kno@@ ck like a w@@ ood@@ pe@@ c@@ ker on my door until i opened it up .
so the engineer &apos;s bos@@ s said , &quot; find a way to qui@@ et this train . &quot;
it has no fresh water that it &apos;s able to drink ,
it &apos;s actually a company a company that i &apos;m involved in called on@@ e@@ sun ,
we use five poly@@ mers in the natural world to do everything that you see .
you know we use p@@ v@@ c , and we she@@ ath wi@@ res with p@@ v@@ c for in@@ su@@ lation .
one of the big ideas , one of the big projects i &apos;ve been hon@@ or@@ ed to work on is a new website . and i would encourage you all to please go to it .
and also , the ea@@ si@@ est one was when i was doing it in form of a music .
i wanted to re@@ ven@@ ge for my village .
i knew it was ru@@ de , but we needed food .
your empty bel@@ lies on the tel@@ ly and now it &apos;s you that i &apos;m fighting for .
i h@@ ated the people in the north .
somebody don@@ ated 20 cents online .
that &apos;s what i want to do to change , to make a difference in the world .
♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ if em@@ ma never resc@@ u@@ ed me ? ♫ ♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ another star@@ ving refuge@@ e ♫ ♫ what would i be ? ♫ ♫ if em@@ ma never resc@@ u@@ ed me ? ♫ ♫ yeah , yeah ♫ ♫ yeah , i would have probably died from star@@ v@@ ation ♫ ♫ or some other w@@ re@@ t@@ ched disease ♫ ♫ i would have grown up with no education ♫ ♫ just another refuge@@ e ♫
so , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , take a look at this .
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to estab@@ lish nor@@ ms , aver@@ ages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;
i spent the last couple of years
in western europe , in many parts of asia , in north america , in australia , wh@@ ite@@ -@@ col@@ lar workers are doing less of this kind of work , and more of this kind of work .
they gave these mit students a bunch of games ,
al@@ ma mat@@ er of el@@ even no@@ bel lau@@ re@@ ates in economics .
but if you want enga@@ gement , self-@@ direction works better .
radical amoun@@ ts of autonom@@ y .
just 10 years ago , if you had gone to an econom@@ ist , anywhere , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got these two different models for creating an en@@ cycl@@ ope@@ dia . if they went head to head , who would win ? &quot;
they thought , &quot; who would use it if you didn &apos;t ? &quot;
the most expensive gri@@ d power in the world is thous@@ and@@ ths of that .
number one question i get asked .
credit cards , robot vacu@@ um clean@@ ers .
because remember dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic &apos;s original idea was his wife &apos;s cell@@ phone be@@ ep@@ ing .
so i think in clos@@ ing , sort of in the im@@ mor@@ tal vi@@ sions of the new yor@@ ker magazine , i thought i &apos;d put up one more slide .
and here you have the dat@@ as@@ et .
look here when i move them forward .
here we come . and that was the influ@@ en@@ za .
whereas china could get healthy much earlier ,
this is east asia , and the light blue there is south asia .
and you have huge differences within countries also .
this is very serious .
the united states has not been so ea@@ ger to use m@@ d@@ g 4 .
they are moving to cities , where they also get better assi@@ stance for that .
the size of the bu@@ bb@@ les is how many are hiv affected .
don &apos;t make it africa . don &apos;t make it a race issue .
and we have to have more concep@@ ts than just developing countries and developing world .
theater a@@ wa@@ kens our sen@@ ses and op@@ ens the door to our imagination .
the use of anima@@ tion and projec@@ tion was a process of discovery .
i know theater can improve the quality of people &apos;s lives , and i know theater can he@@ al .
we teach , touch and move .
you don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
the good news is a third of you didn &apos;t hold up your hand . your apple &apos;s still out there .
with a number of scientists -- particularly at stanford and university of washington -- to ask the question : what &apos;s going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of tra@@ its and character@@ ist@@ ics do we need in our agri@@ cultural cro@@ ps to be able to ad@@ apt to this ?
disa@@ sters have happened . in recent years we lost the gene bank , the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan . you can guess why .
and i know that this ta@@ gs me as a bit of a n@@ erd , but ...
and if cro@@ ps don &apos;t ad@@ apt to climate change , nei@@ ther will agriculture , nei@@ ther will we .
could you put your hand up if you wear gla@@ sses or contact len@@ ses , or you &apos;ve had la@@ ser re@@ fr@@ active surgery ?
now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 25 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and essentially hit@@ ting a bri@@ ck wall in terms of their opportunities .
i have 6@@ 0,000 of these things in my garden .
el@@ der care , child care , already much bigger emplo@@ yers than cars .
and we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement of institutions working on social innovation ,
but interest@@ ingly too , it imp@@ lies a future where society lear@@ ns a few tric@@ ks from capit@@ alism about how you em@@ bed the dna of re@@ st@@ less continu@@ al innovation into society , trying things out and then growing and sc@@ aling the ones that work .

well , for me cy@@ ma@@ tics is an almost ma@@ gical tool .
but consider for a moment that sound does have form .
i &apos;m a st@@ unt c@@ oor@@ din@@ ator . and as well as perform stun@@ ts i often design them .
the fire su@@ its of old , the bul@@ ky su@@ its , the th@@ ick woo@@ len su@@ its , have been replac@@ ed with modern materials like n@@ ome@@ x or , more recently , car@@ bon@@ e@@ x --
they did it by remote control .
that &apos;s the only reason we do it . see , it &apos;s all fun , this job .
which brings us quite ni@@ cel@@ y to why i &apos;m really here today : project space jump .
above 3@@ 0,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet , you need pressure brea@@ thing , which is where you &apos;re wearing a g suit .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
we expect , and others expect , that perhaps the fa@@ a , the ca@@ a might say , &quot; you need to put someone in a suit that &apos;s not inf@@ lat@@ ed , that &apos;s connected to the air@@ craft . &quot;
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 28 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
they &apos;re photo@@ grap@@ ha@@ ble . they &apos;re measu@@ ra@@ ble .
i personally obse@@ ssed about every nu@@ t , bol@@ t and wash@@ er in these crazy things .
you can see that from the oran@@ ge line and the blue line .
the cal@@ ving face is the wall where the visible ice brea@@ ks off , but in fact , it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet .
and you see where it ended in these various spring days , jun@@ e , may , then oc@@ tober .
you can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this , but the camera records it .
it now goes at 12@@ 5 feet a day , du@@ mp@@ ing all this ice into the ocean .
this is a terri@@ fic , terri@@ fic call to arms to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future .
and so ever since i think i was just six years old , i dre@@ am@@ ed of going to the pol@@ ar regions .
i assemb@@ led this team of 29 people from 10 nations .
and they were s@@ wol@@ len so much , i couldn &apos;t even close them .
i so believe in you le@@ w@@ is . i &apos;ve seen the way you &apos;ve been training . and i realize the reason why you &apos;re going to do this .
and to think that in 30 , 40 years they could become extin@@ ct .
those fla@@ gs represen@@ ted the countries from which my team came from .
that is , maybe you have a mind , and everyone else is just a really convin@@ cing robot .
this is a picture of it .
and now , here comes the other p@@ ir@@ ate .
and he takes this one .
child : no , because the wind should get in trouble .
and we can compare that to another case , where everything in the real world is the same .
when you hear clic@@ ks , we &apos;re turning the machine on .
r@@ s : i &apos;m not .
and we don &apos;t know yet what the implic@@ ations will be of understanding it .
now organized crime has been around for a very long time , i hear you say ,
and they were the great cele@@ bri@@ ties of communi@@ sm ,
but also , as they say in the re@@ tail trade , it &apos;s location , location , location .
the con@@ go@@ le@@ se war lor@@ ds were selling this stuff to the ma@@ fi@@ a in exchange for weapons ,
and boy , did that make it easy for the money la@@ under@@ ers .
there has , however , been no con@@ com@@ it@@ ant increase in the resources available to police forces .
the key to cyber@@ crime is what we call social engineering .
there is no roman@@ ce involved with gang@@ sters in the 21st century .
he tri@@ gger@@ ed the moder@@ ni@@ st revolution .
sort of expand@@ ing the public space onto what we ref@@ er to as a sc@@ and@@ in@@ a@@ vi@@ an version of the span@@ ish steps in rome ,
so the people &apos;s building , as we called it .
so that means that all 1.@@ 3 billion chinese have grown up with &quot; the em@@ per@@ or &apos;s new clo@@ thes , &quot; &quot; the mat@@ ch@@ stick girl &quot; and &quot; the little mer@@ ma@@ id . &quot;
sort of continu@@ ing the public real@@ m into the water .
they tried to pass a law against moving the mer@@ ma@@ id .
and essentially the parking is sort of occu@@ p@@ ying the deep space underneath the apart@@ ments .
you always have to sort of ad@@ apt and im@@ provi@@ se to the opportunities and acci@@ dents that happen , and the sort of tur@@ mo@@ il of the world .
and all the sort of ex@@ cess fre@@ sh@@ water wa@@ ste@@ water is fil@@ tered organ@@ ically into the landscape , gradu@@ ally trans@@ forming the desert island into sort of a green , lu@@ sh landscape .
we can see matter . but we can &apos;t see what &apos;s the matter .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ tern@@ al , om@@ ni@@ present , all-@@ powerful .
and you can &apos;t see the past , except in your memory .
but well done , him .
you can &apos;t see a point . it &apos;s by definition dimension@@ less , like an electro@@ n , o@@ dd@@ ly enough .
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
i see cat@@ s and dogs walking towards me .
she was a bright old lady ,
his grand@@ father was a ma@@ gi@@ str@@ ate , an el@@ der@@ ly man . he &apos;d had cat@@ ar@@ act surgery .
and they start to fire spont@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
ker@@ mit the fro@@ g means nothing to me . &quot;
you smell ch@@ est@@ nu@@ ts ro@@ ast@@ ing .
it &apos;s activ@@ ated when one recogni@@ zes carto@@ ons , when one dra@@ ws carto@@ ons , and when one hallucin@@ ates them .
but in fact people say , &quot; i don &apos;t recognize the people . i can &apos;t form any associ@@ ations . &quot;
os : well they don &apos;t di@@ stur@@ b me any more than my tin@@ nit@@ us ,
&lt; / doc &gt;
they had one great lim@@ itation and one great freedom as they tried to con@@ cei@@ ve of a global network .
it &apos;s just part of your neighbor@@ ly du@@ ty .
you see , that announ@@ cement went one click out , which got re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ated , one click out .
if a man named j@@ im@@ bo came up to you in 2001 and said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a great idea ! we start with seven artic@@ les that anybody can e@@ dit anything , at any time , and we &apos;ll get a great en@@ cycl@@ ope@@ dia ! e@@ h ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what keep@@ s wikipedia af@@ lo@@ at .
and to this day , the page for star wars kid has a war@@ ning right at the top that says you are not to put his real name on the page .
i believe we can build architec@@ tures online to make such human requ@@ est@@ s that much easier to do , to make it possible for all of us to see that the data we encoun@@ ter online is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward that actually represents human emotion and en@@ de@@ av@@ or and impact , and to be able to have an eth@@ ical moment where we decide how we want to treat it .
it &apos;s a brilliant idea .
so this is when i ran out of my ide@@ alism and decided to qu@@ it my ngo job and actually study how the internet could im@@ pe@@ de democra@@ ti@@ zation .
the combination of spin , on the one hand , and the internet on the other .
this is what political scientists call auth@@ or@@ itarian deli@@ ber@@ ation ,
but if you look close enough , you &apos;ll actually see that many of the networks and blogs and twitter and facebook were actually oper@@ ational .
well i say we have to stop thinking about the number of i@@ po@@ ds per capit@@ a and start thinking about ways in which we can em@@ power intellec@@ tu@@ als , di@@ ssi@@ dents , n@@ gos and then the members of civil society .
we have seven children in my family . all si@@ sters , excep@@ ting me .
pu@@ mp water meant ir@@ rig@@ ation , a defen@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ encing by that time .
&lt; speaker &gt; tar@@ yn si@@ mon &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i found one section am@@ on@@ gst all of these that actually rese@@ mb@@ led the out@@ line of the united states of america ,
i do take certain liber@@ ties and interven@@ e .
this is an a@@ vi@@ an quar@@ an@@ t@@ ine fac@@ ility where all im@@ por@@ ted birds coming into america are required to under@@ go a 3@@ 0-@@ day quar@@ an@@ t@@ ine , where they are tested for diseases including ex@@ o@@ tic new@@ ca@@ st@@ le disease and a@@ vi@@ an influ@@ en@@ za .
and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
she saw some simil@@ ari@@ ties in one of the photographs , but couldn &apos;t quite make a positive identific@@ ation .
the vic@@ tim failed to identify lar@@ ry in two live lin@@ eu@@ ps
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 4@@ 4 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and the problem is that nei@@ ther side is listening to the other .
i want to share one story about an innovation called dri@@ p ir@@ rig@@ ation .
and so we needed gr@@ ants . and he used significant gr@@ ants to research , to experiment , to fail , to innov@@ ate and try again .
whether it &apos;s by finding those innov@@ ations that can access the capital markets , government itself , or partner with major corpor@@ ations , there is un@@ belie@@ vable opportunity for innovation .
and we dro@@ ve for eight hours along this mo@@ on@@ sc@@ ap@@ e-@@ like landscape with very little color , lots of heat , very little discussion , because we were ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted .
i can only talk from my own experience , but in eight years of running ac@@ u@@ men fund , i &apos;ve seen the power of patient capital .
for you this would be a more appropriate map .
today we have 200 countries in the world .
but in fact , with global warming and ri@@ sing temper@@ atures , all of a sudden you have vast whe@@ at fields and agri@@ business , and gra@@ in being produced in si@@ beri@@ a .
these are the fil@@ ters and fun@@ n@@ els of global capital .
if you add it all up what do you get ?
i don &apos;t believe we should .
if we were to focus on re@@ construc@@ ting these cur@@ vy lines on the map , infrastructure , that cross the straight lines , the bor@@ ders , i believe the middle east would be a far more peac@@ eful region .
the great game con@@ notes domin@@ ance of one over the other .
so in other words , i believe that president sar@@ ko@@ zy of france is right when he talks about a medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an union .
who will win ? canada ? russia ? the united states ?
something like 25 years ago .
and to do that meant creating the f@@ lat@@ test gra@@ di@@ ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ a@@ duc@@ ts across river valle@@ ys -- this is actually the vi@@ a@@ duc@@ t across the th@@ ames at ma@@ iden@@ head -- and long tun@@ n@@ els such as the one at box , in wil@@ t@@ shi@@ re .
what makes technology useful and us@@ able ?
so if human need is the place to start , and proto@@ typ@@ ing , a vehicle for progress , then there are also some questions to ask about the de@@ stin@@ ation .
but , again , we are in the mid@@ st of massive change .
so that &apos;s one thing that we &apos;ve been working on .
discover what it is that gives you pain
and we need to re@@ vi@@ ve that spirit .
because we can change the world , we have the ability .
gar@@ ik isra@@ el@@ ian : how spec@@ tr@@ os@@ copy could reve@@ al ali@@ en life
and actually it &apos;s amazing , because i got phone calls from many repor@@ ters asking , &quot; have you actually seen the planet going into a star ? &quot;
in the core , we have ther@@ monu@@ clear reac@@ tions going on ,
i knew that there is nothing like that obser@@ ved in the galaxy .
and doing this for 14 billion years , we end up with this picture ,
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are te@@ ct@@ on@@ ically dead ,
you can actually go and detect and study a chemical comp@@ osi@@ tion of planets far , far , far from solar system .
in about five years we will discover planets like earth , around sun@@ -@@ like stars , the same distance as the earth from the sun .
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
i arrived there in september 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away .
i think it took me four years to finally read it , while on s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal .
sending mail to japanese design magaz@@ ines and things like that .
that &apos;s connected to a scanner .
there must be something else .
so after eight hours that &apos;s pretty much all that was left of the whole thing .
&lt; speaker &gt; carol@@ yn steel &lt; / speaker &gt;
although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arab@@ les to sal@@ ini@@ zation and er@@ osi@@ on .
and in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
cities used to be con@@ stra@@ ined by geo@@ graphy ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means .
500 years ago it &apos;s what thomas more was asking himself .
this is where food should be in our society .
we need to be thinking more about per@@ mac@@ ul@@ ture ,
what we &apos;re really here to talk about is the &quot; how . &quot;
all of you are members of tri@@ bes .
and i want to make the point that as members of society , we need to .
because it is in stage three that many of us move .
and my question on the other side is just going to be , &quot; what do you think they value ? &quot;
and people came together focused only on those two values : truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
he didn &apos;t say &quot; we have a dream . &quot; he said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
i don &apos;t know anybody .
and they found a way to do the fir@@ st-@@ ever world pol@@ l .
i grew up on a university campus in ea@@ stern nigeria .
now , i loved those american and british books i read .
she asked where i had learned to speak english so well , and was confu@@ sed when i said that nigeria happened to have english as its offici@@ al language .
now , i &apos;ve laugh@@ ed every time i &apos;ve read this .
and then , i was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with shame .
my cou@@ s@@ in pol@@ le died because he could not get ade@@ qu@@ ate healthcare .
now , the conven@@ tional wisdom was that nigeri@@ ans don &apos;t read liter@@ ature .
and we have big dreams of building libr@@ aries and re@@ fur@@ b@@ ishing libr@@ aries that already exist and provi@@ ding books for state schools that don &apos;t have anything in their libr@@ aries , and also of organi@@ zing lots and lots of work@@ shop@@ s , in reading and writing , for all the people who are ea@@ ger to tell our many stories .
and you have to tell me which one .
and now you see it .
we &apos;re very aware of this in the form of more cognitive at@@ tribu@@ tes , like language .
can i have the lights up again ?
here you see four gra@@ y ti@@ les on your left , seven gra@@ y ti@@ les on the right .
we do this in what we call the bee matri@@ x .

we &apos;re not defined by our central properties , by the bits that make us up .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 5@@ 4 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;

sh@@ red@@ dies is a strange , square , who@@ le-@@ gra@@ in cer@@ e@@ al , only available in new ze@@ al@@ and , canada and britain .
there were conserv@@ ative elements in canada , un@@ surpri@@ sing@@ ly , who actually re@@ sen@@ ted this in@@ tru@@ sion .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : hen@@ ry mar@@ kra@@ m says the mysteri@@ es of the mind can be solved -- soon . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electric signals , and he pl@@ ans to find them with a super@@ computer that models all the brain &apos;s 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0,000 syn@@ ap@@ ses .
and you may think that an@@ esthe@@ tics work by sending you into some deep sleep , or by bloc@@ king your recep@@ tors so that you don &apos;t feel pain , but in fact most an@@ esthe@@ tics don &apos;t work that way .
it was so successful in evolution that from mouse to man it expand@@ ed about a thous@@ and@@ fold in terms of the numbers of neurons , to produce this almost fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing or@@ gan , structure .
and it &apos;s not just for neurosci@@ ence ;
so there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another , and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in y@@ ours .
there literally are only a hand@@ ful of equ@@ ations that you need to simul@@ ate the activity of the ne@@ o@@ cortex .
but i hope that you are at least par@@ tly convinced that it is not impossible to build a brain .
it &apos;s when they stop you need to be worried .
and you associ@@ ate it very power@@ fully .
thir@@ dly , make it valuable . give people something with the sound .
an opportunity for the consumer to actually take control and gu@@ ide us to a new tra@@ jec@@ tory in america .
and of course our ban@@ ks did as well , as did our feder@@ al government .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about den@@ ti@@ sts , va@@ se@@ ct@@ om@@ ies , gun@@ s and shark attacks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on ma@@ di@@ son a@@ venue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of lux@@ ury bou@@ ti@@ ques with ordinary , sort of gen@@ eric paper ba@@ gs to hide the brand pur@@ ch@@ ases .
the second of the four values is this movement toward eth@@ ics and fair play .
we &apos;re seeing on our data that consu@@ mers are reali@@ zing this is a marath@@ on , not a spr@@ int .
so , it &apos;s a consumer driven co-@@ op .
and then we look at what companies can do .
what we &apos;re seeing with consu@@ mers right now is the ability for them to actually lead us forward out of this rec@@ es@@ sion .
the way that we did this is we tried to start with em@@ ily her@@ self , who was gr@@ ac@@ i@@ ous enough to come to our laboratory in mar@@ ina del rey , and sit for a se@@ ssion in light stage 5 .
and by looking at how the different color chan@@ n@@ els of the illu@@ min@@ ation , the red and the green and the blue , diff@@ use the light differently , we can come up with a way of sha@@ ding the skin on the computer .
and we &apos;re looking at taking this technology and ap@@ pl@@ ying it to whole human bodies .
not really . if it were that , i would just save you the talk , and teach you the gest@@ ure .
&quot; you come to work . how come you &apos;re so happy ? &quot;
so please , wait for the conduc@@ tor .
i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll get the feeling that i really picked on him because he &apos;s old .
audience : it@@ ay tal@@ ga@@ m : good . now like a kara@@ j@@ an . since you &apos;re already trained , let me concentr@@ ate , close my eyes . come , come .
well , it is different . but isn &apos;t that control@@ ling in the same way ?
and look again at this kle@@ i@@ ber .
and the second thing is it &apos;s about actually being in control , but in a very special way .
and even brief@@ ly , you become the story@@ tel@@ ler to which the community , the whole community , li@@ st@@ ens to .
they started with two and they ended with two .
so , it &apos;s a nor@@ mal@@ -@@ looking sy@@ rin@@ ge .
over 20@@ ,000 econom@@ ists whose job it is , competi@@ tive en@@ try to get there , couldn &apos;t see what was happening .
that &apos;s what the experience of the last 20 years has been .
one of the most dramatic manife@@ stations of these impro@@ ve@@ ments will be moving from population py@@ rami@@ ds to what we might term population co@@ ff@@ ins .
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 20@@ 30 , to destro@@ y the planet , to w@@ rec@@ k everything , through the creation , for example , of a bi@@ op@@ a@@ tho@@ gen .
okay , so , most people only wonder@@ ed that occa@@ sion@@ ally , like today , in brea@@ ks from whatever normally pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed them .
now , what had changed ?
empi@@ ri@@ c@@ ism is in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate because , well , scientific the@@ ories explain the seen in terms of the un@@ seen .
and they don &apos;t percei@@ ve even those as what they really are , nam@@ ely electrical crac@@ k@@ les .
she c@@ ools his dom@@ ain with spring air , ven@@ ting heat up to the surface , creating summer .
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating principle of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
now , in order to do this , we need the right kind of language .
here , we &apos;ve got a proto@@ cell to extr@@ act carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and turn it into car@@ bon@@ ate .
so , here is the technology we have today .
and finally , an obser@@ ver in the future mar@@ vel@@ ing at a beautiful structure in the environment may find it almost impossible to tell whether this structure has been created by a natural process or an artificial one .
and i had time to rel@@ a@@ x and to gri@@ eve .
my talent , my integr@@ ity , my values , everything about me rema@@ ined the same .
and i started writing again .
on the 3@@ 0@@ th of may , 18@@ 32 , a gun@@ shot was heard r@@ inging out across the 13@@ th ar@@ ron@@ dis@@ se@@ ment in par@@ is .
because it is hard to make symme@@ try .
in which the es@@ sa@@ y@@ ist wrote , &quot; in everything , uni@@ form@@ ity is un@@ desi@@ ra@@ ble .
what can i do to the star@@ fish which makes it look the same ?
if i do one magic trick move followed by another , the combination is a third magic trick move .
you don &apos;t see any symme@@ try twice in any row or colum@@ n .
this is a wall , a ce@@ iling , and a floor .
rather than you all shou@@ ting out , i want you to count how many dig@@ its there are in that number . okay ?
g-@@ h@@ -@@ e-@@ z no , so@@ 2 has already been used , actually , in the mathematical language . so you can &apos;t have that one .
and within je@@ wish teach@@ ings , the ra@@ b@@ bin@@ ic teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
therefore , there should be justice throughout the world .
it en@@ ta@@ ils understanding the pain of the other .
and as he was do@@ zing off , they were reading from the book of le@@ vi@@ tic@@ us in the tor@@ ah .
every week , the clean@@ er would come . &quot; god you &apos;ve answer@@ ed my ple@@ a again . &quot;
da@@ y@@ an@@ anda sar@@ as@@ wat@@ i : the profound journey of compassion
the self : you are self-@@ aware .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
that only con@@ fir@@ ms the reality that the wh@@ ol@@ eness cannot be different from you , cannot be min@@ us you .
there is no shor@@ t@@ cut : it is like swi@@ mming by swi@@ mming .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and so , i came to think that mama e@@ tern@@ al , mama e@@ tern@@ al , is always wondering : are all the children in ?
now that &apos;s compassion .
tw@@ el@@ ve in their ec@@ cle@@ si@@ ast@@ ical or cultural or tri@@ bal at@@ ti@@ re af@@ fir@@ ming one message .
a good sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an is not simply one whose heart is tou@@ ched in an immedi@@ ate act of care and char@@ ity , but one who provi@@ des a system of susta@@ ined care -- i like that , &apos; a system of susta@@ ined care &apos; -- in the in@@ n , take care .

he said , &quot; that is the battle of the self , the battle of the e@@ go . &quot;
o , cre@@ ator ! o , the objec@@ tive ! the source of our being and the end of our journey ,
what is the ima@@ gery of god ?
it pa@@ irs clos@@ ely with love , which is the will for the other to be happy ,
and he was ru@@ bb@@ ing it with a clo@@ th .
and there are mag@@ go@@ ts in the fle@@ sh . and it &apos;s terrible .
he jump@@ s back and there , of course , is the future bu@@ dd@@ ha ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya
a famous one , it &apos;s called the &quot; seven@@ fold cau@@ s@@ al method of developing compassion . &quot;
so , we sort of reduce a little of the cl@@ inging to the ones we love -- just in the medi@@ tation -- and we open our mind to those we don &apos;t know .
nobody seems ali@@ en . they &apos;re not &quot; other . &quot; you reduce the feeling of other@@ ness about beings .
but anyway , that &apos;s the &quot; lo@@ vely love . &quot;
and in bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm , they catch it in the future life .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i war@@ ned you this was not going to be very warm and fu@@ zz@@ y .
i don &apos;t quite mean that the gol@@ den rule itself is written in our genes , but you can go to a hun@@ ter gather@@ er society that has had no ex@@ pos@@ ure to any of the great religious tradi@@ tions , no ex@@ pos@@ ure to eth@@ ical philosoph@@ y , and you &apos;ll find , if you spend time with these people , that , basically , they believe that one good turn deser@@ ves another , and that bad de@@ eds should be pu@@ ni@@ shed .
so , it &apos;s these exclu@@ sions to the gol@@ den rule that amount to a lot of the world &apos;s trouble .
it &apos;s going to either be win@@ -@@ win or los@@ e-@@ lose for them .
any form of inter@@ depen@@ dence , or non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum relationship forces you to ac@@ knowledge the humanity of people .
and i &apos;m afraid we have another good news / bad news story , which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 68@@ 0 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and i would actually , i would like to show you that if we actually look at who is doing it , and from where they &apos;re doing it , actually there is an incredible social transformation .
but what is really excep@@ tional is the setting .
and if you think , it &apos;s per@@ me@@ ated our whole culture , even our cities .

culture is a reaction to nature , and this understanding of our ance@@ stors is trans@@ mit@@ ted generation from generation in the form of stories , symb@@ ol@@ s and ritu@@ als , which are always in@@ different to ra@@ tion@@ ality .
alex@@ ander &apos;s mother , his parents , his teacher aristo@@ tle told him the story of hom@@ er &apos;s &quot; ili@@ ad . &quot;
but they were not two characters on two different ad@@ ven@@ tures .
and so , the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator of alex@@ ander &apos;s life was one .
it &apos;s always about taste .
so , i had to take up a job . and i worked in the ph@@ ar@@ ma industry . and i worked in the healthcare industry . and i worked as a marketing guy , and a sal@@ es guy , and a knowledge guy , and a content guy , and a training guy .
and i will share one of the ritu@@ als with you .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : rather than dem@@ o another new technology , tom w@@ u@@ je@@ c reach@@ es back to one of our ear@@ liest but most ingen@@ i@@ ous devices -- the astro@@ la@@ be . with thousands of uses , from telling time to m@@ apping the night sky , this old tech re@@ minds us that the ancient can be as brilliant as the brand@@ -@@ new .
so the north star cor@@ respon@@ ds to the center of the device .
but let me show you how to work this device .
so , in computer graph@@ ics and computer user interface design , there is a term called af@@ for@@ dan@@ ces .
so , what does the astro@@ la@@ be in@@ sp@@ ire ?
you see , i was a study n@@ erd .
and i &apos;ve been able , through this wonderful google and internet , to find the text of the tele@@ gram sent back from president bu@@ chan@@ an to queen vic@@ tori@@ a .
india was not always like this level .
and they could raise the indian flag and become a s@@ over@@ eig@@ n nation , but in very big diffic@@ ul@@ ties down there .
this is the big question today .
it &apos;s quite interesting , isn &apos;t it ?
you see it came down there .
and will asia be able to hand@@ le that new position of being in charge of being the most mi@@ gh@@ ty , and the gover@@ nor@@ s of the world ?
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustain@@ ability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
no . but the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a reali@@ stic asse@@ ss@@ ment of where we are .
the third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely .
and it &apos;s a process which is really jo@@ y@@ ful .
and there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mul@@ ling stage .
we &apos;re getting a lot of interest from government . ed mili@@ band , the energy minister of this country , was invited to come to our recent conference as a key@@ note listen@@ er .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 6@@ 9@@ 8 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
dry areas cover more than one third of the earth &apos;s land sur@@ faces .
this is where the village used to be .
but , by now , you &apos;re probably asking , how am i planning to so@@ li@@ di@@ fy a sand dun@@ e ?
these are ca@@ ver@@ n@@ ous rock structures that i found on the site in so@@ ko@@ to .
and i think now is really the time to turn it into stone . thank you .
but it &apos;s not at the expen@@ se of people accep@@ ting their global respon@@ si@@ bilities .
and whatever the shor@@ t-@@ run price for taking action on climate change or on security , or taking action to provide opportunities for people for education , these are pri@@ ces that are worth paying so that you build a stronger global society where people feel able to feel comfortable with each other and are able to communicate with each other in such a way that you can actually build stronger links between different countries .
so , i think you &apos;re dealing with something that people instin@@ c@@ tively see as part of their moral sense .
since then , the world has moved forward , par@@ tly as a result of what happened with the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st , and people &apos;s concer@@ n about the rights of individuals within terr@@ it@@ ories where they need protection , par@@ tly because of what we saw in rwanda , par@@ tly because of what we saw in bos@@ nia .
america has made its first disp@@ osi@@ tion on this with the bill that president obama should be con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ated for getting through congress .
ca : prime minister , i think there are many in the audience who are truly appreci@@ ative of the effor@@ ts you made in terms of the financial me@@ ss we got ourselves into .
but today , the way i want you to understand a black hole , for the proof of a black hole , is to think of it as an object whose mass is con@@ fin@@ ed to zero volume .
i only need two things .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
and the tool that we use is to watch the way stars or@@ bit the black hole .
and this anima@@ tion here shows you one example of the techniques that we use , called adap@@ tive op@@ tics .
so , there was actually lots of altern@@ atives to the idea that there was a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff in there .
it stri@@ ps that gas cloud apart .
so , we think the future of this experiment is quite exciting .
but suppose you use the green technology , solar pu@@ mp@@ s -- they are of no use in this area .
because we are used to get written things .
the government thought that this is a very back@@ ward area and we should bring a multi-@@ million dollar project to bring water from the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as .
you won &apos;t find water in this slide .
but perhaps they knew that on six@@ th , no@@ ve@@ mber , 2009 , there will be a ted green and blue se@@ ssion , so they pain@@ ted it like this .
this was done in 1@@ 1@@ th century .
you can copy this tat@@ too . i have some po@@ sters of this .

it &apos;s very nice for discussion , disc@@ our@@ se , making films and everything .
they died of aids last year .
and so here is what i came up with . i start fi@@ dd@@ ling with it .
by to@@ y i mean , something you play with that doesn &apos;t have a particular goal .
it &apos;s all &quot; figure . &quot;
now , if you could pick up the black va@@ se , it would look like the figure on top .
here , let &apos;s make it a little harder . still pretty easy .
and it has to be sol@@ vable in a magazine .
then recently &quot; rock band &quot; has been a big hit .
you get more -- down , okay , yeah where is that ? oh , yeah . there , okay . j@@ -@@ o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bo@@ w . that bo@@ w helps .
one of the -- thank you for inv@@ iting us .
and she &apos;s desper@@ ate to find more evidence for the link .
another thing gor@@ don could have mentioned in his speech to the man@@ sion house in 200@@ 2 -- that was to the building ; the people weren &apos;t listening .
and when the crisis was happening , the head of quan@@ tit@@ ative equi@@ ties at le@@ h@@ man brothers said , &quot; events which models predic@@ ted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days . &quot;
i can &apos;t do the whole thing because it would take too long , it really would .
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
that was easy , but then i made the decision , maybe ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary , that they needed to be people of a certain age , which at that point , when i created this program , seemed really old .
this was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual , and having me be the bru@@ sh in their self-@@ portra@@ it .
and so he filled the room , and we had an extraordinary conversation .
i was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say , to break out of their own co@@ c@@ oon of the public self ,
when we were alone , i was her audience .
she wanted the control of her final moment , and she did it ama@@ z@@ ingly .
he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve read everything , and sometimes mr. j@@ eff@@ er@@ son would sm@@ oo@@ th the truth a bit . &quot;
and she was lo@@ ving the pros@@ pe@@ ct of death as much as she had loved life .
&lt; speaker &gt; thu@@ la@@ si@@ ra@@ j ra@@ v@@ illa &lt; / speaker &gt;
a typical day at ara@@ vind , we would do about a thousand sur@@ geri@@ es , maybe see about 6@@ ,000 patients , send out teams into the villa@@ ges to exam@@ ine , bring back patients , lots of tele@@ medicine con@@ sul@@ tations , and , on top of that , do a lot of training , both for doctors and techni@@ cians who will become the future staff of ara@@ vind .
here a community camp just organized by the community themselves ,
we designed a van with a v@@ sat , which sen@@ ds out images of patients to the base hospital where it is diagnos@@ ed ,
and , of course , one needs the mind@@ set to be wan@@ ting to give away what you have as a sur@@ plus .
and there are many which fit this paradig@@ m .
well , i &apos;ve got to tell you , it &apos;s just not going to be pretty .
so , for example , there is the character of noor@@ a .
i &apos;m going to show you how terrorism actually interac@@ ts with our daily life .
she also embr@@ ac@@ ed violence .
and as we were eating , i had the distin@@ ct feeling that i was back in the city of london , having lunch with a fellow ban@@ ker or an econom@@ ist .
and the ir@@ a , which control the private transpor@@ tation system in northern i@@ rel@@ and , did exactly the same thing .
so , this was a v@@ ital injec@@ tion of cas@@ h into the u.s. economy . now , when i went to look at the figu@@ res of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the feder@@ al re@@ serve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy the increase in the demand for dollars , which , of course , reflec@@ ts the growth of the economy .
now , you can imagine what was the reaction of the international finance and ban@@ king .
&lt; speaker &gt; r@@ yan lo@@ bo &lt; / speaker &gt;
in 2007 i went to li@@ beri@@ a , where a group of my friends and i did an independent , self-@@ fun@@ ded film , still in progress , on a very le@@ gen@@ d@@ ary and bru@@ tal war@@ -@@ lor@@ d named general bu@@ tt na@@ ked .
but the question is , does for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess and re@@ de@@ mp@@ tion replace justice ?
and one edi@@ tor told me that she wasn &apos;t interested in doing what she called &quot; manu@@ al labor stories . &quot;
and i &apos;ve had very serious doubt about its eff@@ ic@@ acy , and my own faith in humanity .
in the last four years , we &apos;ve seen all kinds of me@@ mes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page .
which is obvious . it &apos;s a great name .
thank you .
it &apos;s probably the best place in the world to see them .
so , they &apos;re very important .
and i feel very privi@@ le@@ ged to have stu@@ mb@@ led across it living in the mal@@ di@@ ves .
the trees can put their roots into it .

i had a ri@@ gor@@ ous scientific tran@@ sect .

the first step is pattern recogni@@ tion .
what you need to do here is identify as quickly as possible the color of the in@@ k in which these words are prin@@ ted .
but this is how metaphor mis@@ leads .
the lat@@ in word &quot; co@@ gi@@ to &quot; is der@@ i@@ ved from the pre@@ fix &quot; co , &quot; meaning &quot; together , &quot; and the ver@@ b &quot; ag@@ it@@ are , &quot; meaning &quot; to shake . &quot;

if you look 50 years into the future , the way we probably will be making energy is probably one of these three , with some wind , with some other things , but these are going to be the base load energy dri@@ vers .
in the middle of stars , you &apos;re jo@@ ining hydrogen together to make hel@@ ium and then hel@@ ium together to make carbon , to make oxygen , all the things that you &apos;re made of are made in the middle of stars .

and , in fact , we &apos;ve done this .

here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you .
our collective vision at na@@ ya je@@ e@@ van , which for many of you , as you all recognize , means &quot; new life &quot; in ur@@ du and hin@@ di , is to re@@ ju@@ ven@@ ate the lives of millions of low income families by provi@@ ding them with af@@ for@@ d@@ able access to catastro@@ phi@@ c health care .
when i took this picture , the window was fro@@ zen because of the mo@@ ist@@ ure of the night .
you know , when people speak about pion@@ eer@@ ing spirit , very often they believe that pion@@ e@@ ers are the ones who have new ideas .
when brian jon@@ es and i were flying around the world , the weather man asked us , one day , to fly quite low , and very slow .
that &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the automati@@ c way of thinking .
pion@@ eer@@ ing spirit should continue , but on another level .
and that &apos;s exactly why we try to do it .
so , we have to start , and show the example .

sort of ea@@ ves@@ drop on the activity of ner@@ ve cells in the brain .
and that is , there is a sudden emergen@@ ce and rap@@ id spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shel@@ ters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and inter@@ pr@@ et that person &apos;s behavior .
but if you re@@ move the arm , you simply an@@ esthe@@ ti@@ ze my arm , so you put an injec@@ tion into my arm , an@@ esthe@@ ti@@ ze the bra@@ ch@@ ial ple@@ x@@ us , so the arm is nu@@ mb , and there is no sens@@ ations coming in , if i now watch you being tou@@ ched , i literally feel it in my hand .
&lt; speaker &gt; ni@@ ck ve@@ a@@ sey &lt; / speaker &gt;
fairly obvious what that is .
so , that &apos;s an empty par@@ ka jac@@ ket .
so i can take it back to the shop if she didn &apos;t like it .
but i just like it in bright oran@@ ge .
the problem with using living people is that to take an x-@@ ray , if i x-@@ ray you , you get ex@@ posed to radiation .
i travel beyond the surface and show something for what it &apos;s worth , for what it &apos;s really made of , how it really works .
i &apos;m also working now with x-@@ ray video .

in fact we &apos;ve done two more blue zone expedi@@ tions since this and these common den@@ om@@ in@@ ators hold true .

now we are able to follow them and find out their secre@@ ts ,
so , the ti@@ ger is the ic@@ on .
we were actually able to start projects which were basically government suppor@@ ted to collect eg@@ gs from the wild from the few rema@@ ining ne@@ sts
and it came down to something called g@@ out , which , as a result of kid@@ ney break@@ down is actually u@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id cr@@ y@@ st@@ als throughout the body , and worse in the jo@@ in@@ ts , which made the gh@@ ari@@ al un@@ able to swi@@ m .
and development just basically going ber@@ ser@@ k , for a double figure growth index , basically .
do you have those convers@@ ations with people ?
&lt; speaker &gt; her@@ bie han@@ co@@ ck &lt; / speaker &gt;
they already have four children be@@ side them . you can see them .
we gave cycle ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ ws .

children became more compe@@ tent , and less hel@@ ple@@ ss .
here was a city telling its child , &quot; you can . &quot; a gli@@ mp@@ se of infec@@ tion in a@@ h@@ me@@ d@@ ab@@ ad .
child : our parents are il@@ liter@@ ate and we want to teach them how to read and write .
how can we stay immun@@ e to that passion , that energy , that exc@@ it@@ ement ?
and it took them four days .

anyone can suggest changing a name .
there is obviously einstein , ni@@ els bo@@ h@@ r , de fer@@ m@@ at &apos;s last the@@ or@@ em , and i &apos;m not sure whether that &apos;s james co@@ bur@@ n or richard har@@ ris .
and that is , of course , what we are here to talk about .
once again , these guys rock it out .
not sure how this came to be , but it &apos;s not right .
so , then i thought a calcul@@ ator is a metaphor .
because this is the place if ali@@ ens land , i hope they come here . &quot; we are going to destro@@ y the earth . h@@ mm@@ m ... maybe not . &quot;
thank you .
as a young mag@@ ici@@ an , i was obse@@ ssed with hou@@ din@@ i and his underwater challenges .
but this is that at@@ tempt .
and i learned how to slow my heart rate down .
i &apos;m six foot one , and fat .
and by seven minutes i had gone into these awful con@@ vul@@ sions .
so , he suddenly pu@@ shed the record up to 16 minutes and 32 seconds .
normally , i would start at 3@@ 8 be@@ ats per minute , and while holding my breath , it would drop to 12 be@@ ats per minute , which is pretty unusual .
it would ski@@ p a beat .
it &apos;s practice , it &apos;s training , and it &apos;s -- it &apos;s practice , it &apos;s training and experimen@@ ting , while pu@@ shing through the pain to be the best that i can be .
these com@@ ics are a fundamental way that children , especially in the dia@@ spor@@ a , learn their religious and my@@ th@@ ological fol@@ k tal@@ es .
they frequ@@ ently explore the@@ mes of glob@@ alization and ur@@ ban@@ i@@ zation ,
and it shows the first time an or@@ gan was ever transplan@@ ted .
this is actually a picture of a sal@@ am@@ ander .
that &apos;s exactly what you see here .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here . you &apos;re seeing this muscle bio@@ -@@ reac@@ tor actually exer@@ cis@@ ing the muscle back and forth .
same strategy , we take a very small piece of the bla@@ dder , less than half the size of a po@@ stage stam@@ p .
and then the most complex are the so@@ lid organs .
we actually take the don@@ or li@@ ver , we use very mil@@ d deter@@ gen@@ ts , and we , by using these mil@@ d deter@@ gen@@ ts , we take all the cells out of the li@@ ver .
if we cannot use smart biom@@ at@@ eri@@ als , then we &apos;d rather use your very own cells .
and there you see the sta@@ ge@@ co@@ ach driver , and he goes , on the top pan@@ el , he goes a , b , c , d , e , f .

but this part of the equ@@ ation i didn &apos;t really get ,
okay ? almost like the highest in the nation .
and you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the united states .
but it will also be useful for us .
now , i think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architec@@ ts today .
the second position is : actually take posi@@ tions .
now , i &apos;m going to present it on the same terms : issue , position and architec@@ tur@@ al manife@@ station .
now , super@@ fly , the concept is you take all the fre@@ ed@@ om@@ s you normally associ@@ ate with the fl@@ y@@ to@@ wer , and you s@@ me@@ ar them across fl@@ y@@ to@@ wer and audi@@ tori@@ um .
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through the lo@@ bby with our own little dan@@ g@@ ly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads you into the audi@@ tori@@ um .
now , if you were to take a sc@@ ore@@ board and drop it on dir@@ t and wh@@ is@@ key , that would be bad .
the pros@@ cen@@ ium can fly .
so , just in conclu@@ sion , a few sho@@ ts . this is the at &amp; amp ; t performing arts center &apos;s de@@ e and charles w@@ y@@ ly theater .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge mac@@ ro@@ cos@@ m of collective consciousness .

&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
what you see here is a proto@@ typ@@ ic device .
and here you simply bur@@ n it .
the pr@@ inter@@ s cost 800 bu@@ cks now .
&quot; have you taken it every day ? &quot; &quot; yes . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to send out a doctor ,
the answer is that what you do , and the details are not terri@@ bly important here , is to make something more el@@ abor@@ ate : you take several different la@@ yers of paper , each one con@@ ta@@ ining its own little flu@@ id system , and you separate them by pieces of , literally , dou@@ ble@@ -@@ si@@ ded car@@ p@@ et tape , the stuff you use to stick the car@@ pe@@ ts onto the floor .
and we sat down , we did the physics of eg@@ g@@ be@@ at@@ ers and self-@@ ali@@ g@@ ning tu@@ bes and all the rest of that kind of thing , sent it off to a journ@@ al .
so , i actually was interested enough in this to put together several groups of people .
we &apos;ve made small win@@ s in diseases like chron@@ ic my@@ el@@ ogen@@ ous leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a , where we have a p@@ ill that can put 100 percent of people in re@@ mission ,
you start to identify what you could get , and then we can start to work to prevent them .
it is absolutely arch@@ a@@ ic that we call cancer by pro@@ state , by breast , by muscle .
the website says , &quot; if you look , there &apos;s an individual mu@@ tation , and maybe a second , and maybe a third , and that is cancer . &quot;
the key is , when you look at these vari@@ ab@@ les and you look at this data , you have to understand the data in@@ puts .
well , the bad news is that these robu@@ st -- and robu@@ st is a key word -- emer@@ gent systems are very hard to understand in detail .
so the idea that che@@ mo@@ therapy may just be dis@@ rup@@ ting that complex system , just like building bone dis@@ rup@@ ted that system and reduc@@ ed rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ence , che@@ mo@@ therapy may work by that same exact way .
she goes on a p@@ ill a day that tar@@ gets a path@@ way , and again , i &apos;m not sure if this path@@ way was in the system , in the cancer , but it tar@@ ge@@ ted a path@@ way , and a month later , po@@ w , that cancer &apos;s gone .
the ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening .
and so , i im@@ pl@@ ore everyone here : think differently . come up with new ideas .
and one is meaning@@ less without the other .
didn &apos;t have any control over the spi@@ got remo@@ tely .
it could be tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce , or anything could be disp@@ en@@ sed -- sand , po@@ w@@ ders or anything like that .
and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observ@@ ations and appar@@ at@@ us , especially astronom@@ ical forms and the idea of the vast@@ ness of it , the scale , is very interesting to me .
and at first , the par@@ kinson &apos;s was really up@@ setting , because i couldn &apos;t get the pen@@ cil to stand still .
one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy ,
and yet , we all re@@ jec@@ ted this project ,
so this is what i mean with a fa@@ iling govern@@ ance structure , because even the powerful government , which we have in germany , compar@@ ati@@ vely , was not able to say , &quot; we will not allow our companies to bri@@ be ab@@ road . &quot;
we had a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term time perspective .
and this is possible because civil society jo@@ ined the companies and jo@@ ined the government in the analysis of the problem , in the development of re@@ medi@@ es , in the imple@@ men@@ tation of re@@ forms , and then later , in the monit@@ or@@ ing of re@@ forms .
i &apos;m not a doctor ;
england is right behind you , as usual .
i want to introduce you to some of the people that i care about :
an inspi@@ rational man ,
thir@@ ty years ago , most of the food was lar@@ gely local and lar@@ gely fresh .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a speciali@@ st in .
you know , the amount of addi@@ tives , e numbers , ingredi@@ ents you wouldn &apos;t believe --
i want to tell you about something that kind of ep@@ it@@ om@@ i@@ zes the trouble that we &apos;re in , guys , ok ?
now , i don &apos;t know about you guys , but jud@@ ging the circum@@ stances , right , any ju@@ dge in the whole world , would look at the statistics and the evidence , and they would find any government of old gu@@ il@@ ty of child abu@@ se . that &apos;s my belief .
i know how they do it .
and for me , it &apos;s quite roman@@ tic ,
and look , i know it &apos;s weird having an english person standing here before you talking about all this .
so , the first thing that you might notice about the m@@ apping site is just the f@@ lui@@ di@@ ty of the zoo@@ ming and the pan@@ ning , which , if you &apos;re familiar at all with se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , that &apos;s where it comes from .
so you really see how this kind of crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ ced ima@@ gery is integr@@ ating , in a very deep way , into the map itself .
ok , never mind .
thank you all very much .
so what follo@@ ws from that is that if you think it &apos;s all about money -- you can only measure success in public services in health care and education and poli@@ cing by spending more money , you can only measure progress by spending money -- you &apos;re going to have a pretty mis@@ er@@ able time .
you had to have local control because there was no nation@@ all@@ y-@@ available information because travel was so restri@@ cted .
think of the huge change that means :
how do you do it ? well , we &apos;ve had government information campaig@@ ns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .
thank you .
al@@ an k@@ ay calls it , &quot; technology is anything that was invented after you were born . &quot;
well , that &apos;s because they &apos;re all young .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a m@@ clu@@ han sense , an ex@@ tern@@ al stom@@ ach ,
but it &apos;s also law . and of course cities are ways to make things more useful to us .
there is more energy flo@@ wing through , per gram per second , than anything that we have any other experience with .
and that &apos;s the thing that bo@@ thers most people , is that progress is really real , but we wonder and question : what are the environmental costs of it ?
you try it out .
what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences :
phili@@ p k. howard : four ways to fix a broken legal system
she said , &quot; life &apos;s too short , i just can &apos;t keep going with this . &quot;
which is twice as much as in other countries
what does the mac@@ ro@@ -@@ data show us ?
public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago where they found that 4@@ 3 percent of the high school teachers in america say that they spend at least half of their time main@@ ta@@ ining order in the classroom .
i grew up in the south and wh@@ iled away the su@@ mmers fishing .
pretty soon the doctor &apos;s saying , &quot; well , i doubt if that hea@@ da@@ che could be a tumor , but who would protect me if it were ? so maybe i &apos;ll just order the mri . &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s happened . there are no see@@ sa@@ ws , jun@@ gle gy@@ ms , mer@@ r@@ y-@@ go@@ -@@ r@@ ounds , cli@@ mb@@ ing ro@@ p@@ es , nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four , because there &apos;s no risk associated with it .
case dis@@ mis@@ sed without pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce or re@@ fil@@ ing in small cla@@ ims court .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to america . look around .
this is air@@ stri@@ p technologies .

and that &apos;s the question we asked with project prak@@ as@@ h .

you just open the bag , and you just du@@ mp them into the plastic aqu@@ ari@@ um ,
in the new england journ@@ al of medicine , there was a study published that showed that with appropriate re@@ warming , people who had suff@@ ered without a he@@ art@@ beat for three hours could be brought back to life without any neurolo@@ gic problems .
you know ?
and when you go into the research institute , and you say , &quot; hi . i &apos;d like to buy some concentr@@ ated , com@@ pressed gas cy@@ lin@@ ders of a le@@ th@@ al gas because i have these ideas , see , about wan@@ ting to su@@ spend people .
so we started to think : is this the agent that might have been present in the ski@@ er , and might have she had more of it than someone else , and might that have been able to reduce her demand for oxygen before she got so cold that she otherwise would have died , as we found out with our wor@@ m experiments ?
and this all happened really quickly because of a lot of help from a lot of people .
and a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone , and it &apos;s our system whi@@ sp@@ ering to them which p@@ ill they need to take , and they fa@@ ke like they &apos;re having a conversation with a friend .
and then wow , what a radical idea , we -- except in the united states -- might be able to use this new@@ fan@@ g@@ led technology to actually interact with a nur@@ se or a doctor on the other end of the line .

now , to speak about the conditions of well-@@ being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continu@@ um of such facts .
that science is guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every con@@ cei@@ vable moral question .

i come out of the adver@@ ti@@ sing and design business .
there are 200 million letters that go out .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : plan@@ et@@ ary scientist j@@ oel le@@ v@@ ine shows some intri@@ gu@@ ing -- and puzz@@ ling -- new discover@@ ies about mars : cr@@ at@@ ers full of ice , trac@@ es of ancient oceans , and comp@@ el@@ ling hin@@ ts at the presence , some@@ time in the past , of life . he makes the case for going back to mars to find out more .
but because two-@@ thir@@ ds of the earth is covered by water , the land area on mars is compar@@ able to the land area on earth .
there are pol@@ ar cap@@ s of north pole and south pole .
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
this is mars path@@ fin@@ der . this is pho@@ eni@@ x , we just put two years ago .
we can fly above mountains , vol@@ can@@ o@@ es , impact cr@@ at@@ ers ;
ares is 21@@ -@@ foot w@@ ing@@ sp@@ an , 17 feet long .
now , 100,000 feet , if you fly cros@@ s-@@ country to los angeles , you fly 3@@ 7@@ ,000 feet .
we are on the ver@@ ge right now to make the first flight of an airplane outside the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
all the rest were histor@@ ical .
now , how on earth did we get to a situation like this ,
but my children were hun@@ gry .
we &apos;re not about to run out of people . no other com@@ modi@@ ty has that .
and become like sty@@ ro@@ fo@@ am cu@@ ps .
and in a way , without us even notic@@ ing , has ended up standing on the pre@@ cip@@ ice of its own extin@@ ction ,
or in the last ho@@ li@@ day period when we bought ga@@ me@@ boys and i@@ po@@ ds and other tech gif@@ ts for people , we spent 10@@ .@@ 8 billion dollars .
okay , we have to ask ourselves , are we willing to live in a world with sla@@ very ?
we walked through these slu@@ ms , identi@@ fied houses where children would never go to school .
my god ! what a bon@@ ding exercise that was .
you know , when we started with our english medium schools we also decided to adop@@ t the best cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um possible , the ic@@ se cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
we have about three fa@@ thers who have been trained to c@@ ook .
and today she wants to be a neurolo@@ gist .
he has learned how to speak english .
we are dro@@ w@@ ning in news .
a robot they built that can cra@@ w@@ l through the human body .
&lt; speaker &gt; derek si@@ vers &lt; / speaker &gt;
but they will be part of the in-@@ cro@@ wd if they hur@@ ry .
now , what have kids done ?
it shouldn &apos;t be a teacher at the head of the class , telling students , &quot; do this , do that . &quot;
one publi@@ sh@@ er , action publi@@ shing , was willing to take that lea@@ p and trust me , and to listen to what i had to say .
eli@@ za@@ beth p@@ is@@ an@@ i : sex , drugs and hiv -- let &apos;s get rational
it &apos;s getting bl@@ un@@ ter and bl@@ un@@ ter .
&quot; no , no . we share need@@ les because we don &apos;t want to go to ja@@ il . &quot;
there is nothing on the other side .
now , in the rest of the world , we &apos;ve got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very , very low levels -- but we have extra@@ ordin@@ arily high levels of hiv in these other popula@@ tions who are at highest risk : drug injec@@ tors , sex workers and gay men .
well , you die , so your vir@@ al load goes to zero .
we &apos;ve talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days ,
so it &apos;s rational for a drug injec@@ tor to share need@@ les because of a stupid decision that &apos;s made by a politi@@ ci@@ an , and it &apos;s rational for a politi@@ ci@@ an to make that stupid decision because they &apos;re respon@@ ding to what they think the vo@@ ters want .
the people that fund all the advanced technologies that businesses and univer@@ si@@ ties probably wouldn &apos;t take the risk of doing .
&quot; oh , by the way de@@ an . it &apos;s going to fit on a 50@@ th per@@ centi@@ le female frame --
at the end of exactly one year we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom , all the sens@@ ors , all the micro@@ process@@ ors , all the stuff inside .
imagine doing that with a woo@@ den stick and a h@@ ook on the end of it , doing either of those .
i can give you fast control with low reduc@@ tion ra@@ ti@@ os in these ge@@ ars , or i can give you power ;
then we went out to broo@@ ke army medical center .
there were 3@@ ,@@ 500 people , the veter@@ an &apos;s administ@@ ration , u.s. ... just 3@@ ,@@ 500 at this huge event to help the families of all the kids --
i don &apos;t have the answer . but let me give you a simple concer@@ n or maybe statement , then .
it &apos;s a robot that has three legs , which is inspired by nature .
so we have two proto@@ types .
ah , isn &apos;t that cool ?
the students like to have fun . and here you can see that it &apos;s walking over un@@ struc@@ tured ter@@ rain .
the best part , it took only $ 200 dollars to make the first prototype .
however , still , as you can see , it has a cor@@ d , um@@ bi@@ lic@@ al cor@@ d . so , we &apos;re still using an ex@@ tern@@ al power source and ex@@ tern@@ al compu@@ tation .
thank you .
every day in the morning , the first thing i do before my first cup of coffee , before i bru@@ sh my teeth , i open my no@@ te@@ book .
bat@@ man , fighting against bad guys , he has his u@@ til@@ ity belt , he has his grap@@ pl@@ ing h@@ ook , he has all different kinds of ga@@ d@@ gets .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : pollen goes un@@ noticed by most of us , except when ha@@ y fe@@ ver stri@@ kes . but micros@@ cop@@ es reve@@ al it comes in stun@@ ning colors and shapes -- and tra@@ vels remark@@ ably well . jonathan dr@@ or@@ i gives an up@@ -@@ close gli@@ mp@@ se of these fascinating f@@ lec@@ ks of plant cour@@ t@@ ship .
if you actually didn &apos;t realize that plants have sex , they have ra@@ mp@@ ant , promis@@ cu@@ ous and really quite interesting and curious sex . really .
no co@@ inci@@ dence that these were taken by ro@@ b k@@ es@@ sel@@ er , who is an artist ,
there is an invisible beauty all around us , each gra@@ in with a story to tell ... each of us , in fact , with a story to tell from the pollen fing@@ er@@ print that &apos;s upon us .
taking them off the dead , flat pages .
♫ mar@@ ries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one mar@@ ries me ♫ ♫ mar@@ ries me ♫ ♫ well , if no one mar@@ ries me ♫ thank you .
i &apos;d like to thank everybody , all the scientists , the philosoph@@ ers , the architec@@ ts , the inven@@ tors , the biolo@@ gists , the bo@@ tan@@ ists , the artists ...
&lt; speaker &gt; jonathan klein &lt; / speaker &gt;
well , i think what is far worse is man &apos;s destruc@@ tive power over man .
i &apos;ll show you one photo here , and it &apos;s a photo by eu@@ gene ri@@ char@@ ds of an iraq war veter@@ an from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called war is personal .
but can i use a paper to@@ wel ? the answer to this can be found in em@@ bo@@ died energy .
it takes some energy , but if you de@@ construc@@ t it -- you take it all apart , you use the bits -- you can get some of that energy back .
now , i probably would have up@@ gra@@ ded the old house to be more ener@@ g@@ y-@@ efficient ,
and i remember my first real contact with o@@ ct@@ op@@ us was probably at age five or six .
i went up to the front of the tank , and he &apos;s just star@@ ing at me ,
and i remember that pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al light going off in my head ,
but this particular one used vision .
but we &apos;re just going to zi@@ p right past this area , this area that inclu@@ des about 95 percent of the living space on our planet and go to the mid-@@ ocean ri@@ dge , which i think is even more extraordinary .
and before the discovery of these ven@@ ts , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sis . but down there , there is no sun , there is no pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sis ;
so this rain@@ water is f@@ loo@@ ding down the h@@ ill@@ side , carrying with it se@@ di@@ ments from the construction site , smo@@ ther@@ ing the coral and killing it .
and these problems are so large and global , and it &apos;s just over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s too big or too tox@@ ic for a land@@ fill , deep six it ! &quot;
it sou@@ ght to express the ways in which art could provide a space for di@@ alo@@ gue -- complicated di@@ alo@@ gue , di@@ alo@@ gue with many , many points of en@@ try -- and how the museum could be the space for this con@@ test of ideas .
in some cases , i know that many of you are involved in cros@@ s-@@ cultural di@@ alo@@ gues , you &apos;re involved in ideas of creativity and innovation .
where can a museum exist as the place for us all to have this conversation ?
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
in the ocean , it &apos;s the rule rather than the excep@@ tion .
well , that was the question that 19@@ th century french phy@@ si@@ ologist rap@@ ha@@ el du@@ bo@@ is , asked about this bi@@ ol@@ u@@ min@@ es@@ cent cla@@ m .
so instead , it sli@@ des in groo@@ ves on the outside of the head .
they use it a lot for defen@@ se , many different ways .
and once this disp@@ lay gets going , i &apos;m not tou@@ ching it anymore .
so that i could test it and we could figure out , you know , for example , which colors of red light we had to use so that we could see the animals , but they couldn &apos;t see us -- get the electron@@ ic j@@ el@@ ly@@ fish working .
so if you ever , ever get an opportunity to take a di@@ ve in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , say yes -- a thousand times , yes -- and please turn out the lights .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
oh , they also say they will sell you astro@@ lo@@ gy or other fortun@@ e@@ telling metho@@ ds .
good b@@ ye . &quot;
you stop brea@@ thing , and then you &apos;re dead .
that &apos;s her , you can tell right away .
she did this on the &quot; lar@@ ry king live &quot; show on c@@ n@@ n six and a half years ago .
i don &apos;t really need it because i &apos;ve been doing this st@@ unt for audi@@ ences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years , taking fat@@ al dos@@ es of home@@ op@@ ath@@ ic sleep@@ ing p@@ ills .
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look sil@@ ly ? just to get rid of this god@@ less person out there that syl@@ via brow@@ ne talks about all the time ?
oh , we get lots of them , hundreds of them every year come by .
the problem is that , what begins as a trage@@ dy in the third world could easily become a global problem .
so this will allow us to create person@@ alized medic@@ ines in the third world at a cost that is actually achie@@ vable
well , unfortunately , i &apos;ve got so many vi@@ a@@ gr@@ a ads coming at me , your email is lost .
ad hom@@ in@@ em attacks will get you no@@ where .
and if you have ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship and want to communicate , that di@@ alo@@ gue is incredibly powerful .
what allows women to re@@ plant trees , to re@@ build societies , to lead radical , non-@@ violent movements for social change ?
this is tradition . &quot;
she starts every lec@@ ture with a pra@@ yer , but she &apos;s a single , fe@@ ist@@ y , financi@@ ally independent woman in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12 .
so enter a group of out dy@@ kes , young women who love the old music that once spread across that region from mac@@ ed@@ on@@ ia to bos@@ nia , from ser@@ bia to slo@@ ven@@ ia .
but she was sick with worry :
with their rema@@ ining fun@@ ds , they took a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks
that &apos;s the heat from the bottom .
we can use our tradition to navi@@ gate change .
and i &apos;m happy to say that that &apos;s led to many good things in r &amp; amp ; d and education , lots of other areas .
this science is different , more general , than the mathema@@ tic@@ s-@@ based science that we &apos;ve had for the past 300 or so years .
its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine that compu@@ tes answers to questions .
but the goal is to go much further and , very broad@@ ly , to democra@@ ti@@ ze all of this knowledge , and to try and be an auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative source in all areas . to be able to compu@@ te answers to specific questions that people have , not by search@@ ing what other people may have written down before , but by using built in knowledge to compu@@ te fresh new answers to specific questions .
on the one hand , we have mathema@@ tica , with its sort of preci@@ se , form@@ al language and a huge network of carefully designed cap@@ abilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
something like rule 30 , for example , turns out to be a really good rand@@ om@@ ness gener@@ ator .
one &apos;s got to build a lot of technology .
that &apos;s one of the ways that you get towards true complexity .
and no matter how long i &apos;ve spent on the ocean , i haven &apos;t yet managed to mu@@ ster a de@@ cent be@@ ard , and i hope that it remains that way .
and my ti@@ ming was not great either :
i just felt like a movie star .
well , naturally , you decide to row across the pacific .
awful , really awful .
and this is really bad news because plastic is not an in@@ ert sub@@ stance .
i found out that people had ro@@ wed across oceans .
i plan on being around for a long time , and when i &apos;m 90 years old , i want to be happy and healthy .
the trouble is , i don &apos;t .
and the other , of course , is a birth control p@@ ill , which , in a very simple way , fundamen@@ tally changed the structure of society
and , interest@@ ingly , complexity is very highly evolved .
and it &apos;s like the traffic that you see . the amazing thing about the cell is that it actually does main@@ tain a fairly stable working relationship with other cells ,
the question is : why is bin@@ ary si@@ m@@ pl@@ er than arab@@ ic ?
with integr@@ ated circuit@@ s , you can build cell@@ phones .
that is , you can st@@ ack them .
that is to say , if we can make the basic technology of one or two things work , it will be applic@@ able to a very , very large variety of human conditions ,
at the compon@@ ents from which the system is made and exam@@ ine their frag@@ ility , or their st@@ ability ,
and also , could you create the worst possible ted@@ talk that they would still let you get away with ?
you &apos;ll all stay with me .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and the gdp in africa is not making much progress .
and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
but how do you do that ? do you hi@@ re teachers ? do you build more schools ?
but maybe there is another problem as well .
that &apos;s not bad , that &apos;s a good impro@@ vement .
well , what you can see is that when people have to pay for their bed ne@@ ts , the cover@@ age rate really falls down a lot .
and then can@@ als were built , and with the same hor@@ se@@ man and the same horse , you could carry ten times as much car@@ go .
and they are good , scientific , robu@@ st answers .
with de@@ wor@@ ming , you can get an extra year of education for three dollars .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
their compe@@ tit@@ ors are equ@@ ally qu@@ ali@@ fied to make all of these products .
it &apos;s also responsible for all human behavior , all deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making , and it has no capacity for language .
sam@@ u@@ el pi@@ er@@ pon@@ t lang@@ ley was given 50,000 dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine .
they tell stories of how every time the w@@ right brothers went out , they would have to take five sets of parts , because that &apos;s how many times they would crash before sup@@ per .
because , you see , the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first .
i mean , we use ti@@ vo as ver@@ b .
he went around and told people what he believed .
and it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to in@@ sp@@ ire those around them or find others who in@@ sp@@ ire them .
and she was hot .
people came to study our re@@ efs from australia , which is sort of funny because now we go to the@@ irs .
and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ j@@ ure up much of a sense of well-@@ being , because it just keep@@ s getting worse .
and they ta@@ sted really good .
it was acci@@ den@@ tally released from the aqu@@ ari@@ um in mon@@ ac@@ o ,
you &apos;re looking at one tox@@ ic din@@ of@@ la@@ gel@@ late bloo@@ m that can kill fish ,
i think it &apos;s sort of funny ; it &apos;s on the si@@ beri@@ an coast ,
and the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this , is do we know how to put hu@@ mp@@ ty du@@ mp@@ ty back together again ?
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
is it that i analy@@ ze the data very well ?
that is a great trage@@ dy -- which i &apos;m carrying still with me and i hope that all of you will carry this with you -- that the profes@@ sion still le@@ giti@@ mi@@ zes public@@ ation of knowledge of people without at@@ tribu@@ ting them by making them anony@@ mous .
it depends upon how you look at the life of the people .
do poor have legs , mouth and hands , but no head ?
now , this lady , on the wall of the dun@@ g ca@@ ke hea@@ p , has made a painting .
they don &apos;t want secon@@ d-@@ standard , secon@@ d-@@ quality out@@ puts .
and that is what man@@ su@@ k@@ h b@@ ha@@ i pra@@ jap@@ at@@ i has done .
sa@@ i@@ dul@@ la@@ h sa@@ hi@@ b is an amazing man .
because otherwise she had to make a big platform and then clim@@ b her &#91; un@@ clear &#93; would clim@@ b on that .
and this brea@@ thing appar@@ at@@ us now saved the life ,
&lt; / doc &gt;
so i started to see the world in a completely new way
this here shows , on the y-@@ ax@@ is , the increase in the prob@@ ability that a person is obe@@ se given that a social contact of the@@ irs is obe@@ se
bl@@ ame your fat friends . &quot; what was interesting to us is that the european head@@ line writ@@ ers had a different take : they said , &quot; are your friends ga@@ ining weight ? perhaps you are to bl@@ ame . &quot;
and , eventually , we became interested in emotions .
and you might form the intui@@ tion that the un@@ happy people occu@@ p@@ y a different structur@@ al location within the network .
they would say , &quot; i &apos;ve got six friends . that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
it is the ties between people that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts .
we invent .
so we made this thing .
that &apos;s great , except the places that have malaria really bad , they don &apos;t have health care systems .
and once you see blood ves@@ sels , we think we can see the malaria .
there &apos;s all these different interven@@ tions
now , one of the ways you can make them not fly is with d@@ dt .
and farmers could protect their cro@@ ps that they want to sell to whole foo@@ ds because our pho@@ tons are 100 percent organic .
here you can see that the insects are being trac@@ ked as they &apos;re flying around , which is kind of fun .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and it has several un@@ in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited , un@@ f@@ ished , pri@@ st@@ ine islands and a few in@@ ha@@ b@@ ited islands .
most of the biom@@ as@@ s is low on the food chain , the her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , the par@@ rot@@ fish , the sur@@ ge@@ on@@ fish that eat the al@@ ga@@ e .
in fan@@ ning island , the cor@@ als are not rec@@ overed .
so let me just give you a sum@@ mary of what no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves do . these places , when we protect them ,
so the fis@@ her@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
so how much of this do we have ?
well , there are three main reasons why we don &apos;t have tens of thousands of small reser@@ ves :
en@@ ri@@ c sal@@ a : thank you . ca : that was a ma@@ ster@@ ful job of pul@@ ling things together .
es : and then we have the under@@ -@@ performance of f@@ ish@@ eri@@ es that is 50 billion dollars .
i teach high school math .
this is really destruc@@ tive .
but what you have here is actually four separate la@@ yers ,
he talked about the formu@@ lation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the u.s. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t invol@@ ve them in the formu@@ lation of the problem .
so i won &apos;t talk about it .
which , wow .
and she goes , &quot; and what &apos;s this fer@@ tili@@ zing ? &quot;
&quot; human males and fe@@ males develop a special b@@ ond , and when they &apos;re much older , much , much older than you , and they have a very special feeling , then they can be na@@ ked together . &quot;
so we put in dogs mat@@ ing , and , you know , we &apos;re watching it , and she &apos;s totally absor@@ bed .
now , the remarkable thing about blood ves@@ sels is that they have this ability to ad@@ apt to whatever environment they &apos;re growing in .
and on the other end , exc@@ es@@ sive angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is -- too many blood ves@@ sels -- drives disease ,
cancer cells mu@@ t@@ ate , and they gain the ability to release lots of those angi@@ ogen@@ ic factors , natural fer@@ tili@@ zer , that tip the balance in fa@@ vor of blood ves@@ sels inva@@ ding the cancer . and once those ves@@ sels inva@@ de the cancer , it can exp@@ and , it can inva@@ de local tis@@ su@@ es ,
and over the course of seven months , the can@@ c@@ ers completely dis@@ appeared , and the bi@@ op@@ sies came back as normal .
but i actually took a completely opposite approach , and began asking : what could we be ad@@ ding to our diet that &apos;s naturally anti@@ angi@@ ogen@@ ic , and that could bo@@ ost the body &apos;s defen@@ se system , and beat back those blood ves@@ sels that are fe@@ eding can@@ c@@ ers ?
stat@@ ins , non@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ al anti-@@ inf@@ lam@@ mat@@ ory drugs , and a few others -- they in@@ hi@@ bit angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is , too .
if you take the obe@@ se mouse and give it an angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or , it los@@ es weight .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and i guess i just wasn &apos;t quite ready .
so , please ask y@@ ourselves , for your health , for your po@@ c@@ ket@@ book , for the environment , for the animals : what &apos;s stop@@ ping you from giving we@@ ek@@ day ve@@ g a shot ?
and when i came at age 22 to live on fer@@ n@@ and@@ ina ,
the other thing is , i &apos;ve never met anybody that really doesn &apos;t say that they like pengu@@ ins .
and you can imagine sleep@@ ing on fer@@ n@@ and@@ ina your first night there and you hear this lon@@ e@@ some , pla@@ in@@ t@@ ful call .
so when i went to study the ma@@ gel@@ lan@@ ic pengu@@ ins , i didn &apos;t have any problems .
because they don &apos;t pay the real environmental costs .
and what the pengu@@ ins show us -- and these are all the little dots from where the pengu@@ ins &apos; posi@@ tions were for pengu@@ ins in in@@ cu@@ b@@ ation in 2003 --
this is tur@@ bo the pengu@@ in .
okay , so here are a few pengu@@ ins coming in .
the talk will be broad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
so oil is playing a less significant role every year .
and it &apos;s just li@@ me@@ stone , nothing really special about it .
and i &apos;ll suggest that this coal is about as exciting as this ch@@ al@@ k .
so this is the first self-@@ replic@@ ating species that we &apos;ve had on the planet whose par@@ ent is a computer .
so , sub@@ stan@@ tially larger than we even thought we would go ini@@ tially .
so our team developed new techniques for actually growing , cl@@ oning entire bacter@@ ial chromos@@ om@@ es in yea@@ st .
we felt one of the ten@@ ets of this field was to make absolutely certain we could di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish synthe@@ tic dna from natural dna .
and they came down on the side of open public@@ ation , which is the right approach --
we need some altern@@ atives for oil .
i mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously ,
you have to create the circum@@ stances where they show themselves .
&quot; as our case is new , so we must think an@@ e@@ w and act an@@ e@@ w .
they see no reason to do this .
&quot; always . i &apos;ve always been a fire@@ man . &quot;
kids sitting in front of uni@@ m@@ pressed pan@@ els , you know , with their re@@ su@@ mes -- f@@ lic@@ king through and saying , &quot; what , this is it ? &quot;
my wife &apos;s just finished writing a novel , and i think it &apos;s a great book , but she dis@@ appears for hours on end .
and he says , &quot; i &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
you might also be asking whether it &apos;s possible that this is illegal for her to do this .
they can take any element from any gar@@ ment from the history of fashion and in@@ corpor@@ ate it into their own design .
tom ford : and we found after much research that -- actually not much research , quite simple research -- that the counter@@ feit custom@@ er was not our custom@@ er .
it forced him to be a little more innov@@ ative .
and that &apos;s sort of like the no@@ vel@@ ty standard for a u.s. patent , which fashion designers never get -- rar@@ ely get here in the states .
ha@@ ir@@ do@@ s , no copy@@ right protection .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
sh@@ arm@@ een o@@ ba@@ id@@ -@@ ch@@ in@@ o@@ y : inside a school for su@@ ici@@ de bom@@ bers
ha : if god gives me strength .
step five : i believe the taliban have one of the most effective means of pro@@ pag@@ anda .
sing@@ er : ♫ on the day of jud@@ gment ♫ ♫ my god will call me ♫ ♫ my body will be put back together ♫ ♫ and god will ask me why i did this ♫ so@@ c : i leave you all with this thought : if you grew up in these circum@@ stances , fac@@ ed with these choices , would you choose to live in this world or in the gl@@ ori@@ ous after@@ life ?
and then we get a pande@@ mic .
so let &apos;s explore how vacc@@ ines work .
so that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different stra@@ in of flu .
the vaccine effort though is really quite different .
and as you can imagine , these three-@@ dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
so what happened ?
with a range of new technologies , we could .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be thre@@ aten@@ ed by infec@@ tious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
it probably isn &apos;t the perfect vaccine , but it &apos;s moving along .
perfect .
they want to regul@@ ate us , those conserv@@ atives , to stop us from allo@@ wing the market to spread in those places .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re em@@ ul@@ ating the original ma@@ shu@@ p .
now , my concer@@ n is , we de@@ ms , too often , not so much .
and we should remember who emplo@@ yed the shar@@ ec@@ ro@@ p@@ pers :
but then i went to the site and all of the audi@@ o in my site had been sil@@ enced .
open@@ ness is a commit@@ ment to a certain set of values .
and to write a new operating system was not a cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous matter .
the lu@@ min@@ ous room is a system in which it &apos;s considered that input and out@@ put spaces are co-@@ loc@@ ated .
it projects down digital sha@@ dows , as you see here .
let &apos;s do something a little more difficult .
so here &apos;s a familiar place .
all right . so collabor@@ ative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ loc@@ ated or di@@ stant and distin@@ ct , is always important .
can it be for every man , or is this just for corpor@@ ations and movie produc@@ ers ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
they only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
as i w@@ ander@@ ed around and made these pictures , it sort of occur@@ red to me that the ocean &apos;s not a gro@@ cer@@ y store , you know .

but , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 in@@ ches long swi@@ mming in about a foot of water .
the north atlan@@ tic right wh@@ ale is li@@ sted as the most en@@ danger@@ ed species on the planet today because they are urban wh@@ ales ; they live along the east coast of north america , united states and canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story i did on marine reser@@ ves as sort of a solution to the problem of over@@ fishing , the global fish crisis story .
i became an underwater photo@@ grapher because i fell in love with the sea , and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
and that &apos;s led to this discussion that &apos;s completely ra@@ w , completely un@@ fil@@ tered .
so somebody at time , at the magazine , thought it would be fun to n@@ om@@ in@@ ate me for this thing they did last year .
they took the youtube video and they ma@@ shed everything in the video .
but i think that the greater good is being served here by just allo@@ wing people -- there are very few places , now , where you can go and not have identity , to be completely anony@@ mous and say whatever you &apos;d like .
you &apos;ve got this surprising se@@ mi@@ -@@ under@@ ground influence , but it &apos;s not making you a lot of money , yet .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 8@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
so it isn &apos;t in the series .
so what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon europa , which is a th@@ ick s@@ heet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers th@@ ick .
what about scientific discovery ?
it &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most di@@ stant stars and galaxies .
it was made in stars like that , loc@@ ked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in expl@@ osi@@ ons like that in order to re@@ con@@ dense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
it &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from earth , trans@@ mit@@ ting with that dish , with the power of 20 wat@@ ts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it .
&quot; we know enough at the turn of the 19@@ th century .
and we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
and they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audi@@ o from the machine to play part of the song .
you know , we spent a lot of time ide@@ ating and even building some of these things .
we are ok go . have you read the &quot; natural curi@@ osity cab@@ in@@ et ? &quot;
we need to re@@ discover the lost art of democratic argument .
who else ?
now , flu@@ tes may seem ... the distribution of flu@@ tes may seem a tri@@ vi@@ al case .
someone who would not gr@@ ant ca@@ sey martin the right to a golf car@@ t ,
that &apos;s part of the game of golf ? ms : what &apos;s your name ? ms : war@@ ren .
and that walking was not essential , but inci@@ den@@ tal .
that illustr@@ ates that with golf , as with flu@@ tes , it &apos;s hard to decide the question of what justice requires , without grap@@ pl@@ ing with the question , &quot; what is the essential nature of the activity in question ,
thank you very much .

our li@@ ve@@ stock was almost at the br@@ in@@ k of extin@@ ction , protected as well .
three things that actually help to build on this foundation :
the other partners that we have got is business communities .
this is our new economy -- an economy based on the respect of our natural resources .
remember me asking a few questions which still pre@@ occu@@ p@@ y me .
you have a series of bu@@ tt@@ ons . you actually choose your lift music .
a yellow sign ? that &apos;s exactly what they &apos;ll be expe@@ cting .
but what &apos;s interesting about that suggesti@@ on was that , to imple@@ ment that suggesti@@ on wouldn &apos;t cost 10 million pounds ; it wouldn &apos;t invol@@ ve large amoun@@ ts of expen@@ di@@ ture ; it would actually cost about 50 qu@@ id .
that &apos;s called tri@@ via .
which means we &apos;re going to take a vote at the end and see how that shif@@ ts , if at all .
nuclear is and has been for 40 years .
in terms of weapons , the best dis@@ ar@@ ma@@ ment tool so far is nuclear energy .
mark jac@@ ob@@ son : thank you .
let &apos;s say we conver@@ ted all the vehic@@ les in the united states to battery electric vehic@@ les , hydrogen fuel cell vehic@@ les or fle@@ x fuel vehic@@ les run on e@@ 85 .
we have fac@@ ili@@ ties around there . you also have a buff@@ er zone that &apos;s 17 square kilometers .
and we can guar@@ an@@ te@@ e a clean , blue sky or an un@@ certain future with nuclear power .
there &apos;s absolutely no need for nuclear power .
anyone else for ? go .
your final pit@@ ch , ste@@ wart .
so , people of the ted community , i put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy .
&quot; by talking heads ) so the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
there &apos;s no big room to create re@@ ver@@ ber@@ ation and confu@@ se the rhy@@ th@@ ms .
he wanted a little more bom@@ bast ,
and a new form of music was born .
people began to make music specifically for disc@@ os and for those sound systems .
in other ways , it &apos;s more like the west african music because if the music in an mp@@ 3 player gets too qui@@ et , you turn it up , and the next minute , your e@@ ars are bla@@ sted out by a l@@ ouder passa@@ ge .
and they &apos;ll vote for that .
which translat@@ es to &quot; p@@ se@@ u@@ dos@@ ci@@ enti@@ fic bal@@ on@@ ey &quot; -- would be the nice word -- in which you str@@ ing together a bunch of words that sound good ,
a type i er@@ ror , or fal@@ se positive , is belie@@ ving a pattern is real when it &apos;s not .
and is it really a horse ?
while you &apos;re thinking about that , this was an experiment done by su@@ san blac@@ k@@ more , a psycholo@@ gist in england , who showed subjec@@ ts this de@@ gra@@ ded image and then ran a cor@@ rel@@ ation between their scor@@ es on an es@@ p test : how much did they believe in the par@@ an@@ or@@ mal , super@@ natural , an@@ gels and so forth .
too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere .
and he was kind enough to post this and give us the reve@@ al .
especially when they &apos;re up@@ side down ,
some con@@ spir@@ ac@@ ies really are true .
nar@@ r@@ ator : this is the venue they chose for their fa@@ ke audi@@ tions for an adver@@ t for li@@ p bal@@ m .
it &apos;s a complex web of relationships and a critical part of our cultural landscape .
well , most rights ow@@ ners , instead of bloc@@ king , will allow the copy to be published .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s a big problem , and it &apos;s complicated and me@@ ss@@ y .
thank you so much . i &apos;m going to try to take you on a journey of the underwater ac@@ ou@@ stic world of wh@@ ales and dolph@@ ins .
it &apos;s really important for our music and our language .
whereas these members of a pair go &quot; w@@ o-@@ ot , w@@ o-@@ ot , w@@ o-@@ ot . &quot;
to me , the most min@@ d-@@ ben@@ ding example of the inter@@ connec@@ ted@@ ness of the ocean where oce@@ an@@ o@@ graph@@ ers took a ship to the southern indian ocean , de@@ plo@@ yed an underwater l@@ oud@@ speaker and played back a sound .
this means that hu@@ mp@@ back song is a form of animal culture , just like music for humans would be .
here &apos;s the same call recorded from a hydro@@ phone 500 miles away .
and this is the kind of call that is used by , say , right wh@@ ale mothers and cal@@ ves as they separate to come back again .
so at this point , it &apos;s pri@@ mar@@ ily an issue of cost and stand@@ ards .
but then they often wait there .
and what i &apos;ve been really passionate about ever since -- and i &apos;ve never spo@@ ken about this ever , until now -- so this is the first time anyone &apos;s ever heard it , except my wife three days ago , because she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; and i told her -- is that i think we miss an opportunity
i think we have an o@@ bli@@ g@@ ation as parents and a society to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish --
i have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention de@@ fic@@ it dis@@ order diagnos@@ ed .
the definition of an entrepr@@ en@@ eur is &quot; a person who organi@@ zes , oper@@ ates and assu@@ mes the risk of a business venture . &quot;
i even knew at a seven@@ -year-old age that i could actually get a frac@@ tional percent of a cent , and people would pay that because it multi@@ p@@ lied up .
you &apos;ve got this demand over here that has money .
and i thought that was kind of cool .
and people could never get their ba@@ gs up it .
i had the pin@@ n@@ ac@@ les and dd@@ h@@ s and the really cool ones back then .
allo@@ wan@@ ces teach kids the wrong ha@@ bits .
maybe four ni@@ ghts out of the week read them bed@@ time stories and three ni@@ ghts of the week have them tell stories .

but i needed something else .
she was also called si@@ m@@ han@@ and@@ in@@ i , the one who rode the lion .
as i spent time with vi@@ vi@@ an , i saw that she had sort of a jo@@ ie de vi@@ v@@ re in how she did her work .
i took one psychology class in college , and i learned about this guy , ab@@ ra@@ ham ma@@ slow , as many of us are familiar with his hier@@ arch@@ y of needs .
what we can measure is that tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff at the bottom of the py@@ rami@@ d .
for the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started meas@@ uring and mana@@ ging around happiness in b@@ hu@@ tan --
or in other words , i think the b@@ hu@@ tan@@ ese believe happiness equ@@ als wan@@ ting what you have --
as you look at these two colum@@ ns here , doesn &apos;t it make you feel like it &apos;s time for us to start fig@@ uring out a new way to count , a new way to imagine what &apos;s important to us in life ?
i guess i &apos;m sort of a curious ceo .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
but i find that for myself , without excep@@ tion , the more i deal with the work as something of my own , as something that is personal , the more successful it is as something that &apos;s comp@@ el@@ ling , interesting and susta@@ ining .
and this way , working with the art director , i &apos;m able to bring it to just the right point that it &apos;s puzz@@ ling for the audience -- they can figure out that there &apos;s something they have to read -- but it &apos;s not impossible for them to read .
so i &apos;m using my own writ@@ ings as a kind of testing ground for a book that has an inter@@ depen@@ den@@ cy between word and image as a kind of se@@ duc@@ tive force .
and those who didn &apos;t respond will never recei@@ ve anything from me ever again .
i &apos;m just really , really thr@@ il@@ led with them .
so that &apos;s why i do what i do , and why i spend so much time and effort on it , and why i work in the commercial , public sphere , as op@@ posed to the isol@@ ated , private sphere of fine art :
the question that you will ask will deter@@ mine much of the answer that you get .
it was bor@@ ing .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the k@@ ings and que@@ ens of kenya or britain .
well , education is a global religion .
so time and again , i found people like this .
so i met this character , steven .
and there will be no mista@@ kes . &quot;
there are form@@ al sett@@ ings -- schools , colle@@ ges , hospitals -- in which innovation can take place , and inform@@ al sett@@ ings -- communities , families , social networks .
and finally , you need transforma@@ tional innovation that could imagine getting learning to people in completely new and different ways .

and we put down those little floor ti@@ les ,
i &apos;m kind of into this stuff , and i &apos;m going to stop being embar@@ ra@@ ssed . &quot;
there &apos;s a whole gra@@ y market for le@@ go , thousands of hom@@ e-@@ based businesses .
and there was a law@@ yer in nai@@ ro@@ bi , ory ok@@ ol@@ lo@@ h -- who some of you may know from her ted@@ talk -- who began blo@@ gging about it on her site , ken@@ yan pun@@ dit .
now what ok@@ ol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without digital technology .
now i want to sti@@ pul@@ ate , as the law@@ yers say , that l@@ ol@@ cat@@ s are the stu@@ p@@ ide@@ st possible creative act .
they studied those da@@ y@@ care centers at the time of highest ten@@ sion , which is pic@@ k-@@ up time .
nothing changes .
the number of people who are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects is going to grow ,
i think there are any number of reasons ,
but is it practical ?
and they now have a relatively central location .
and especially as sub@@ ur@@ bia is becoming less cen@@ tered on the family , the family house@@ hol@@ ds , there &apos;s a real hun@@ ger for more third places .
this was a very large m@@ all on a hundre@@ d-@@ ac@@ re super@@ block .
but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
but da@@ y@@ ligh@@ ting our cre@@ eks really impro@@ ves their water quality and contribu@@ tions to habitat .
they have urban stre@@ et@@ sc@@ apes , but sub@@ urban parking ra@@ ti@@ os .
and those simple the@@ mes aren &apos;t really the@@ mes about the complex science of what &apos;s going on , but things that we all pretty well know .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to pre@@ serve when we say , &quot; save the ocean . he@@ al the ocean . &quot;
p@@ c@@ bs accu@@ mul@@ ate in dolph@@ ins in sar@@ as@@ o@@ ta bay , in texas , in north carolina .
and that huge load was passing into the people that ate this meat .
there &apos;s other ways of breaking the py@@ rami@@ d .
these same infec@@ tions create har@@ m@@ ful alg@@ al bloo@@ ms .
it happened because many people put their time and effort and their pion@@ eer@@ ing spirit into this .
&#91; the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as . &#93; the flat horizon that we &apos;ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infin@@ ite : un@@ b@@ ounded resources and un@@ limited capacity for disp@@ os@@ al of waste .
but these are posi@@ tions , the lat@@ est posi@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve m@@ apped ,
so i &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is .
it is the landscape , right ?

so we said scre@@ w it , we &apos;ll just start our own company , which we did three years ago .

remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
and the same thing with the atmosphere :
you see a lot of oil on the ocean .
and so you can see , literally , signs of their sho@@ ck , signs of their ou@@ tra@@ ge , signs of their an@@ ger , and signs of their gri@@ ef .
when it brea@@ ks up , it has a long way to go before it gets down to bacteria .
so the gul@@ f is a really important piece of water -- more important than a similar volume of water in the open atlan@@ tic ocean .
so this is a he@@ mi@@ sp@@ h@@ eric issue .
there is am@@ ple opportunity for oil and dir@@ ty water to get in behind them .
that &apos;s certainly one of the things we need to do .
the first off@@ sh@@ ore dr@@ ills were called har@@ po@@ ons .
a cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment was going to shor@@ ten our lives .
and that &apos;s because they &apos;re both designed to fit the human hand .
so what sex does is it enab@@ les the individual to draw upon the genetic innov@@ ations of the whole species .
so o@@ z is better at both spe@@ ars and ax@@ es than adam .
in other words , the average person on the average wa@@ ge could not afford a cand@@ le in 18@@ 00 .
we &apos;re able to draw upon speciali@@ zation and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living stand@@ ards .
and so both sides raise each other &apos;s stand@@ ards of living through the sexual di@@ vision of labor .
and that will have led to speciali@@ zation .

twitter recently did some research .
now , ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te has been right about a lot of things .
when we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible , and we look at what actually happens , we start reali@@ zing that the world doesn &apos;t work quite the same way that we think it does .
in the u.k. , you can get up , you can pick up your computer when you get out of this se@@ ssion , you could read a newspaper from india or from australia , from canada , god for@@ bi@@ d from the u.@@ s .

is very mathematical and cer@@ e@@ br@@ al .
so to me , it was normal that there be more international characters in it than tur@@ k@@ ish characters ,
a function is at@@ tribu@@ ted to fiction .
they would go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often impro@@ vis@@ ing .
in that sense , i like to think of my fiction as both local and universal , both from here and everywhere .
they connect all humanity , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of identity politics ,

and that , after a couple of days , made the ken@@ yan press feel safe to talk about it .
we ended up sending two people to ba@@ gh@@ dad to further research that story .
ja : well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve re@@ form .

and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it ,

when you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be big brother exer@@ ting more control , more secre@@ cy , or us watching big brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?

the small planets domin@@ ated , and there was a certain harmon@@ y to that , which actually c@@ oper@@ ni@@ cus was very happy to note , and ke@@ pl@@ er was one of the big pro@@ pon@@ ents of .
but the statist@@ ical result is l@@ oud and clear .
and that &apos;s a very basic question , which we don &apos;t know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
and that deeper , under@@ lying point is that science is in the process of re@@ defin@@ ing life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observ@@ able universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .

our break@@ through was to create an algorith@@ m that un@@ fol@@ ds the cortex , so that we can map the signals closer to its source , and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population .
and now that that &apos;s done , we can choose a move@@ men@@ t-@@ based action .
eg : losing concentra@@ tion .
we are really only scrat@@ ching the surface of what is possible today ,
what if all the replac@@ e@@ ments our bodies need already exist in nature , or within our own stem cells ?
and i started first with co@@ w ach@@ il@@ les ten@@ don ,
we can use th@@ ic@@ ker , youn@@ ger , better tis@@ su@@ es than you might have in@@ ju@@ red in your k@@ nee , or that you might have when you &apos;re 40 , 50 or 60 .
&quot; i know , &quot; i said . &quot; i &apos;m aware of this cu@@ st@@ om .
this is the only way to en@@ sure that your pre@@ fer@@ ences and interests will be most fully accoun@@ ted for .
for them , choice was not just a way of defin@@ ing and as@@ ser@@ ting their individu@@ ality , but a way to create community and harmon@@ y by de@@ fer@@ ring to the choices of people whom they tru@@ sted and respec@@ ted .
i was so struc@@ k by this com@@ ment that from then on , i started to offer all the partici@@ pants those seven so@@ da@@ s ,
they practice this from such an early age that they &apos;ve come to believe that everyone must be born with this ability .
what do they do ?
the story americans tell , the story upon which the american dream depends , is the story of lim@@ it@@ less choice .
she@@ en@@ a , there is a detail about your bio@@ graphy that we have not written in the program book .
and what i wonder@@ ed was whether they were being affected by the name or the content of the color ,
so my project is along the nor@@ th@@ west atlan@@ tic .
but i was the reci@@ pi@@ ent of a lot of fl@@ ame re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant material for some reason .
i felt like my thro@@ at was on fire .
independent researchers found that .
so from a to@@ xic@@ ology perspective , this is really awful because cor@@ ex@@ it and the disp@@ er@@ sed oil are much more tox@@ ic together than either alone .
so we know from previous sp@@ ills .
the cor@@ ex@@ it is transpor@@ ting the oil into every me@@ m@@ bran@@ e and every system of the body .
we have some of the partners lin@@ ed up .
&#91; stre@@ t@@ ching across to sa@@ do &#93; &#91; the mil@@ ky way &#93; . &quot; bas@@ h@@ o was a brilliant man .
and basically , our challenge is to optimi@@ ze the benefits and mi@@ ti@@ gate the risks of living on a planet that &apos;s driven by only two processes , two sources of energy ,
now a layer in , the other two or three hundred processes that are all interac@@ ting , par@@ tly as a function of temperature , par@@ tly as a function of all the other factors , and you &apos;ve got a really complicated system .
this is very , very exciting .
we will be present throughout the volume of the ocean , at will , communic@@ ating in real time .
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own port .
and these are the things that we &apos;re fun@@ ded to do today .
it &apos;s far beyond what we currently have .
but so the goal here is real time interaction with the oceans from anywhere on earth .
don &apos;t worry , i &apos;m not going to call anyone in particular out on any aspec@@ ts of your own mista@@ kes .
so this is the question my students and i wanted to get at .
so we said , well , maybe we should just , actually just su@@ ck it up and teach mon@@ keys how to use money .
and so our mon@@ key marke@@ t@@ place was born .
question is : do the mon@@ keys start me@@ ssing up in the same ways we do ?
people are a little ri@@ sk@@ -@@ aver@@ se . so what ?
that means when we &apos;re in a risk mind@@ set -- ex@@ cu@@ se me , when we &apos;re in a loss mind@@ set , we actually become more ri@@ sky , which can actually be really wor@@ rying .
maybe we should see how they do with los@@ ses .
because we &apos;ve answer@@ ed the question we started out with .
we actually have all of these cases where we over@@ come our biological lim@@ it@@ ations through technology and other means , seem@@ ingly pretty easily .
and then i said to myself , i &apos;ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
many , many people have died on mt . ever@@ est , and this was the year they decided to go and rec@@ over all the bodies of the moun@@ ta@@ ine@@ ers and then bring them down the mountain .
and there , we sat down , and we did a de@@ brief about what had gone wrong there on mt . ever@@ est .
and then the second lesson , the radical , tac@@ tical shift .
i asse@@ ssed how long they were going to stay and how much it would take to feed them .
because the people who were gather@@ ing brazil nu@@ ts weren &apos;t the same people who were cu@@ tting the forests .
if we were farmers , we &apos;d be eating our seed .
we can get efficiency up .
they may have a lot of opini@@ ons about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terri@@ bly in@@ formed .

20 percent goes to a bas@@ ket that is a combination of alco@@ hol , to@@ bac@@ co , su@@ g@@ ary drin@@ ks -- and pro@@ stitu@@ tion and fe@@ sti@@ v@@ als .
the second it@@ em on the agenda is mat@@ ern@@ al mortality .
the doctors and nur@@ ses there noticed that she was not only a survi@@ vor , she was really cle@@ ver , and they made her a nur@@ se .
and then , when she had to transport all of the em@@ bro@@ i@@ der@@ y goods from the village to the marke@@ t@@ place , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hi@@ red her husband .
she scor@@ ed brilli@@ antly on the national exam@@ in@@ ations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the united states on schol@@ ar@@ ship .
so then , i ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
&lt; speaker &gt; peter m@@ oly@@ neu@@ x &lt; / speaker &gt;
his parents are too bu@@ sy to listen to his problems , and that &apos;s when he starts almost con@@ j@@ uring you up .
so we &apos;ve tac@@ kle@@ d that problem , and we &apos;ve come up with a solution , which we &apos;ll see in a second .
they &apos;re fine with teaching mil@@ o for the first few thro@@ ws , but then they want to beat mil@@ o , where women , they &apos;re more nur@@ turing about this .
now &apos;s a chance for di@@ mit@@ ri to kind of reas@@ sure and cal@@ m mil@@ o down .
the cool thing is that we &apos;re doing as well : as you interact with him , you &apos;re able to put things into his world ; he recogni@@ zes objects .
an un@@ fortun@@ ate connection for us maybe , but it re@@ minds me that we &apos;d like to thank one man for , over the past decade , working ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly to support com@@ edi@@ ans all around the world , specifically com@@ edi@@ ans with a middle ea@@ stern background .
first , the ax@@ is guys recorded a com@@ edy central special
anywhere you go .
we have a positive story to tell and image to sell .
the other f@@ ounding members inclu@@ ded a@@ h@@ med a@@ h@@ med , who is an egyp@@ ti@@ an-@@ american , who actually had the idea to go to the middle east and try it out .
his name was j@@ ab@@ bar . &quot;
that &apos;s what i try and show in my stand@@ -up . there &apos;s good people everywhere .
i was in om@@ an , and i was in sau@@ di arab@@ ia .
and when you put your two year-old on a slide in the united states , they put something on the slide to slow the kid down as he comes down the slide .
who knows , maybe one day we &apos;ll even have our own james b@@ ond , right .
it &apos;s filled with lots of different things that , in short , aren &apos;t that fun .
i mean , we want to build frame@@ works in a way that makes it accep@@ table and makes it , you know , productive down the road .
so i just recently dro@@ pped out of prin@@ ce@@ ton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
you should lose points for not doing this on time .
and at prin@@ ce@@ ton , they &apos;ve actually experimen@@ ted with this ,
and is able to drive meaningful re@@ venue and fun and enga@@ gement to businesses .
and so , i &apos;ve got about 20 seconds left ,
20 billion for this war .
and when you &apos;re lost in information , an information map is kind of useful .
but ap@@ ri@@ l isn &apos;t a particularly massive month for video games .
any other gu@@ ess@@ es ?
it &apos;s being p@@ ou@@ red into our eyes through the web , and we &apos;re all visu@@ ali@@ zers now ; we &apos;re all dem@@ and@@ ing a visual aspect to our information .
massive . 6@@ 0@@ 9 billion in 2008 -- 6@@ 0@@ 7 , rather .
we need rel@@ ative figu@@ res that are connected to other data so that we can see a ful@@ ler picture ,
and then i can say , &quot; well , just show me the stuff that affec@@ ts heart health . &quot;
so that &apos;s what &apos;s exciting to me , seeing how data can change my perspective and change my mind mid@@ stream -- beautiful , lo@@ vely data .
early explor@@ ers rub@@ bed coca@@ ine in their eyes to kill the pain of it .
at the pe@@ ak of activity earlier this year , the researchers lo@@ wer@@ ed the dr@@ ill an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day and another 3@@ 65 years deeper into the past .
we ban@@ ned those chemicals , and we replac@@ ed them , un@@ know@@ ingly , with other sub@@ stances that , molecule per molecule , are a hundred times more po@@ tent as he@@ at@@ -@@ tr@@ apping , green@@ house g@@ ases than carbon dioxide .
jim too@@ me@@ y : learning from sher@@ man the shark
and i fle@@ w in a small plane low over the islands .
it would start a whole new space race .
let &apos;s see .
so , imagine a great white shark and a giant squ@@ id in the same ba@@ th@@ room .
and it ended up in the bo@@ ise river and then on to the colum@@ bia river and then to the mouth of the colum@@ bia and to the pacific ocean and then on to this place called the great pacific gar@@ bage pat@@ ch -- which is this giant pacific gy@@ re in the north pacific , where a lot of this plastic ends up flo@@ ating around -- and then back onto the la@@ g@@ oon .
mean@@ while , er@@ nest fin@@ ds his fin@@ s on the internet .
and you realize where you are ; you &apos;re in the lou@@ v@@ re .
i highly re@@ com@@ mend that you get a chance to see cru@@ de oil bur@@ n some@@ day , because you will never need to hear another pol@@ i sc@@ i lec@@ ture on the ge@@ op@@ oli@@ tics of oil again .
when the chemistry of the oil and water also hits our politics , it &apos;s absolutely expl@@ osi@@ ve .
i mean -- and this is funny ,
there were pu@@ ff@@ s under the little color@@ less eyes with cre@@ ases running from them . &quot;
but it &apos;s also really important that we don &apos;t get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted by the theater or the mor@@ als of it .
i was there in 2003 .
gas@@ ol@@ ine costs are a tremendous dra@@ in on the american economy , but they &apos;re also a dra@@ in on individual families
and you can find more about this policy .
but in order to do this , one of the things we really need to do , is we need to remember we are people of the hydro@@ carbon .
it &apos;s the same with br@@ ands :
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consu@@ mers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ cip@@ ate they &apos;ll do .
you can get a strong brand image or a message and put it out there like the conserv@@ ative party did earlier this year with their election poster .
he said , &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
come on . in the western world , we have enough .
these seem to be natural human a@@ spi@@ ra@@ tions .
and the yellow do@@ t there you see , is the global average .
what &apos;s happening in co@@ sta ri@@ ca ?
this is what the u.k. government target on carbon and green@@ house emissions looks like .
and we need positive feedback loo@@ ps for increasing well-@@ being
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course .
and we need to have sign@@ po@@ sts gather@@ ing people together and poin@@ ting them -- something like the happy planet index .
we go from a couple of million people to the seven billion people we are today . the me@@ sop@@ o@@ tam@@ ian culture : we invent agriculture , we dom@@ est@@ ic@@ ate animals and plants .
the decade when we have to b@@ end the cur@@ ves .
and could we even , thanks to major advan@@ ce@@ ments in earth systems science , identify the thre@@ sh@@ ol@@ ds , the points where we may expect non@@ lin@@ ear change ?
well , there &apos;s no science to suggest .
it has to basically do this on current land .

it more felt to be the case to me that i was being treated like a stat@@ ue , and i was to sit in one place like a stat@@ ue would .
but the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spiritu@@ ality on the part of the muslim and bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ st tradi@@ tions .
t@@ d : la@@ k@@ sh@@ mi has worked incredibly hard , even in inv@@ iting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen ,
ide@@ ally you would not be satis@@ fied until you &apos;d actually done the work . but when you tell someone your goal and they ac@@ knowledge it , psycholo@@ gists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;

one was when i had been dro@@ pped off by boat on a remote f@@ jor@@ d , only to find that the arch@@ e@@ ologists i was supposed to meet were no@@ where to be found .
this is at about 60 feet or 18 meters , dep@@ th .
any gu@@ ess@@ es ?
and what &apos;s more , it &apos;s actually a tree .
this is the cl@@ on@@ al mo@@ ja@@ ve y@@ u@@ c@@ ca , it &apos;s about a mile away , and it &apos;s a little bit older than 12@@ ,000 years .
thank you .
they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time .
and when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
the first experiment i did out of new@@ ca@@ st@@ le was actually done in india .
and then that &apos;s her over there .
&quot; you can exchange groups .

i sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students .

my brothers started giving me a few ti@@ ps about drawing and painting .
and that fascin@@ ated me , to explore that terr@@ it@@ ory .

it &apos;s just created by the mind .
i couldn &apos;t find it .
it &apos;s just all about questi@@ oning the pre@@ concep@@ tions .
that ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ating sculp@@ ture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture &#91; the &#93; invisible .
it &apos;s called &quot; breath . &quot; it &apos;s just two holes on the g@@ aller@@ y wall .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : after 15 years in the british diplom@@ ati@@ c cor@@ ps , car@@ ne ross became a &quot; fre@@ el@@ ance diplom@@ at , &quot; running a b@@ old non@@ profit that gives small , developing and ye@@ t-@@ un@@ recogni@@ zed nations a voice in international rel@@ ations . at the bi@@ f-@@ 5 conference , he calls for a new kind of diplom@@ acy that gives voice to small countries , that works with changing bound@@ aries and that wel@@ comes innovation .
and my ambi@@ tion was se@@ aled .
i negoti@@ ated for my country the re@@ solution in the security coun@@ cil of the 12@@ th of september 2001 con@@ dem@@ ning the attacks of the day before , which were , of course , deeply present to us actually living in new york at the time .
what was i going to do ?
and i gave it up .
and the kos@@ o@@ v@@ ars were not allowed a diplom@@ ati@@ c service .
and watching ? what if !
i can connect any one of you by six degrees of separ@@ ation to the al-@@ sha@@ b@@ aa@@ b mili@@ ti@@ a in som@@ ali@@ a .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
&lt; speaker &gt; ben camer@@ on &lt; / speaker &gt;
these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this ter@@ rain .
but the number of arts partici@@ pants , people who write poetry , who sing son@@ gs , who perform in church cho@@ irs , is explo@@ ding beyond our wil@@ dest imagin@@ ations .
ultimately , especially now in this world , where we live in a context of re@@ gre@@ ssive and on@@ er@@ ous im@@ migra@@ tion laws , in reality tv that th@@ ri@@ ves on hu@@ mili@@ ation , and in a context of analysis , where the thing we hear most repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly , da@@ y-@@ in , da@@ y-@@ out in the united states , in every train station , every bus station , every plane station is , &quot; ladies and gentlemen , please report any susp@@ ici@@ ous behavior or susp@@ ici@@ ous individuals to the auth@@ orities ne@@ ar@@ est you , &quot;
if you were to ask me , you know , &quot; what do you worry about the most ?
we are , right now , at 3@@ 90 parts per million of co2 in the atmosphere .
but to answer that question , to make a clear at@@ tribu@@ tion to carbon dioxide , you have to know something about all of these other agen@@ ts of change .
and we dr@@ il@@ led in the ross sea .
this se@@ di@@ ment is 100 percent made up of the shel@@ ls of micros@@ cop@@ ic plants .
it &apos;s about a meter t@@ all pa@@ v@@ on@@ a cla@@ v@@ us col@@ ony .
the core comes up as these cy@@ lin@@ dri@@ cal tu@@ bes of li@@ me@@ stone .
it &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
you know , we &apos;ve war@@ med the glo@@ be about a degree centi@@ grade in the last century , and there &apos;s nothing in the natural part of that record that rese@@ mb@@ les what we &apos;ve seen in the last century .
and we take sam@@ ples of the se@@ di@@ ment , and it tells us the co2 level of the ocean , and therefore the co2 level of the atmosphere .
but recently , i &apos;ve become intri@@ gu@@ ed by a different way of thinking of large human crow@@ ds ,
rais@@ ing the bar cru@@ el@@ ly for the next generation of spea@@ kers ,
and ama@@ z@@ ingly , you can still see what the best can do , because the cro@@ wd itself sh@@ ines a light on them ,
so , at ted , we &apos;ve become a little obse@@ ssed with this idea of open@@ ness .
the first few years of the web were pretty much vide@@ o-@@ free ,
it can take months for a scientist in another lab to figure out how to replic@@ ate the experiments that are described in print .
500 years ago , it ran into a compe@@ tit@@ or with a le@@ th@@ al advantage .
it &apos;s the particip@@ ation age , right ?
they used the same tra@@ sh to form green man@@ ure .
and so plants and animals developed their own intern@@ al c@@ loc@@ ks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
and in-@@ between , they have a couple of hours of sort of medi@@ t@@ ative qui@@ et in bed .
so one of the first things we thought we would tac@@ k@@ le would be how we go about predic@@ ting epide@@ mic@@ s .
you could have friend@@ ship relationships , si@@ b@@ ling relationships , sp@@ ous@@ al relationships , co-@@ wor@@ ker relationships , neigh@@ bor relationships and the like .
in the do@@ t@@ ted red line , we show what the adop@@ tion would be in the random people ,
because now , with this idea we can take a random sample of people , have them n@@ om@@ in@@ ate their friends , those friends would be more central , and we could do this without having to map the network .
the red dots are going to be cases of the flu , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu .
would you get any popula@@ tion@@ -@@ level im@@ m@@ unity ?
and collect vast amoun@@ ts of information about people &apos;s temperature , but from centr@@ ally loc@@ ated individuals .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hur@@ dy@@ -@@ g@@ ur@@ dy .
this is a song that i wrote based on traditional bas@@ que rhy@@ th@@ ms .
so what i did is , i took all this research and i made it into a -- well , basically it &apos;s a product cat@@ alo@@ g of this one p@@ ig , and it carri@@ es a du@@ p@@ lic@@ ate of his ear tag on the back .
and what it is -- it &apos;s actually ste@@ ak .
and what happens is this can be im@@ plan@@ ted into a human heart without open heart surgery . and once it &apos;s in the right spot , they re@@ move the ou@@ ter shel@@ l , and the heart val@@ ve , well , it gets this shape and at that moment it starts be@@ ating , instan@@ tly .
this is the grand caf@@ e here in oxford .
kind of sig@@ nature behavior that shows up again and again in all of these environments .
so they started to think , &quot; could we build a ne@@ on@@ at@@ al in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator that &apos;s built entirely out of autom@@ ob@@ ile parts ? &quot;
he went to a bunch of science la@@ bs around the world and vide@@ o@@ tap@@ ed everyone as they were doing every little bit of their job .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long hal@@ f-@@ life , right ?
we may be the first people in the united states to be listening to this . we should record it . &quot;
and that &apos;s how gps was born .
hiv isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ;
and yet , the reality in resour@@ ce-@@ poor countries ,
that means doctors and nur@@ ses simply don &apos;t have the time to take care of patients .
imagine yourself , if you can , you &apos;re a young woman in africa , you &apos;re going to the hospital or clin@@ ic .
we bring mothers who have hiv , who &apos;ve been through these p@@ m@@ t@@ ct programs in the very fac@@ ili@@ ties , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nur@@ ses as part of the health care team .
we try to bring in the hus@@ b@@ ands , the partners .
and so the men@@ tor mother went along with .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nur@@ ses , really than doctors ,
our men@@ tor mothers do .
mb : simple solutions to complex problems .
and so , sub@@ sequ@@ ently i particip@@ ated in every single 4@@ 66@@ 64 event that i could take part in and gave news confer@@ ences , intervie@@ ws , talking and using my platform as a musici@@ an , with my commit@@ ment to mand@@ ela -- out of respect for the tremendous , un@@ belie@@ vable work that he had done .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years --
i tell her story to everyone because she represents one of millions of hiv / aids or@@ ph@@ ans .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
we shift the gra@@ vit@@ ational center of it .
you can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 9@@ 65 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
reduc@@ tive listening is listening &quot; for . &quot;
so , we &apos;re inv@@ iting into our lives the voices of people who are not present with us .
let &apos;s move away from bad sound and look at some friends that i ur@@ ge you to se@@ ek out .
i hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .
g@@ ary wol@@ f : the qu@@ anti@@ fied self
you &apos;re probably familiar with the ni@@ ke + system .
and the self isn &apos;t the only thing ; it &apos;s not even most things .
yes ?
what &apos;s in that information ?
if we continue through the entire st@@ ack , we can re@@ construc@@ t the three-@@ dimensional shape of a small frag@@ ment of a bran@@ ch of a neuron .
or maybe really , really fine cap@@ el@@ lin@@ i with bran@@ ches .
and indeed , these days i har@@ bor new hop@@ es .
what &apos;s in this picture ?
and this sequence of ne@@ ural activ@@ ation is hypothe@@ si@@ zed to be the ne@@ ural basis of those sequence of movements .
i mention this because there are pro@@ p@@ he@@ ts today who claim that technology will fundamen@@ tally al@@ ter the human condition and perhaps even transform the human species .
&lt; / doc &gt;
why ?
somebody has to feel how you felt .
we succe@@ eded .
and also -- i think -- without psycho@@ -@@ social therapy , and without consi@@ dering this in all human@@ itarian projects , we cannot buil@@ d-@@ up civil societies .
the women said , &quot; we agree . we &apos;ll use p@@ ills , but we need a doctor to pre@@ scri@@ be the p@@ ills , &quot;
wher@@ ever you find people , you &apos;ll find contrac@@ ep@@ tives in tha@@ il@@ and .
and before long , the con@@ dom was know as the girl &apos;s best friend .
and i thought a ho@@ t@@ dog will be more symbo@@ lic .
he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot .
and this is probably the best thing he &apos;s ever done with his mb@@ a .
we had con@@ dom@@ s in all the re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators in the ho@@ tels and the schools , because alco@@ hol im@@ pa@@ irs jud@@ gment .
and we believe if you want to help the poor , access to credit must be a human right .
and here is a bam@@ bo@@ o building --
i also want to tell you and share with you how my team and i have been using mu@@ sh@@ rooms over the last three years .
i say far less , because 10 percent isn &apos;t going to cut it .
our vision is local manufacturing , like the local food movement , for production .
a major fortun@@ e 500 fur@@ nit@@ ure maker uses these corner blocks to protect their tab@@ les in shi@@ pment .
tim jac@@ k@@ son : an economic reality check
this is the carbon inten@@ sity of economic growth in the economy at the moment .
stat@@ us@@ -@@ driven , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ u@@ ous consumption th@@ ri@@ ves from the language of no@@ vel@@ ty . and here , all of a sudden , we have a system that is loc@@ king economic structure with social lo@@ gic -- the economic institutions , and who we are as people , loc@@ ked together to drive an engine of growth .
they want to hun@@ ker down , they want to look to the future .
that is a deeply hu@@ mani@@ zing vision of our lives , and it &apos;s a completely different vision than the one that lies at the heart of this economic model .
and ec@@ os@@ ia works in pretty much the same way .
and this too requires investment , investment -- for example , in places -- places where we can connect , places where we can participate , shared spaces , conc@@ ert h@@ alls , gar@@ dens , public par@@ ks , libr@@ aries , muse@@ u@@ ms , qui@@ et centers , places of joy and cele@@ bra@@ tion , places of tran@@ qu@@ ility and con@@ temp@@ lation , sites for the &quot; cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ation of a common citi@@ zen@@ ship , &quot; in michael san@@ del &apos;s lo@@ vely phra@@ se .
i mean , can you picture a politi@@ ci@@ an standing up in britain and saying , &quot; gdp fell two percent this year . good news !
&lt; speaker &gt; bar@@ bar@@ a block &lt; / speaker &gt;
some of you may be gu@@ il@@ ty of having contribu@@ ted to the de@@ mise of blu@@ ef@@ in .
we don &apos;t know where the structure is .
what do they like to eat ?
we send this fish back into the sea .
with the help of my former post@@ doc , g@@ are@@ th law@@ son , this is a gor@@ ge@@ ous picture of a single tun@@ a .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places we need to protect .
so in this case , s@@ al &apos;s looking at two ta@@ gs there ,
so this is just three years of data right here --
a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the gol@@ den gate bridge .
and this , with meas@@ uring .
how many children did you have ?
it was down here .
this is the average for all of sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
congo got into civil war , and they le@@ vel@@ ed off here .
we had primary school actually started in 18@@ 42 .
now , let me now bring you to a wi@@ der picture , a wi@@ der picture of child mortality .
come on . we want everyone down there .
these are the african countries .
imagine , if you will -- a gift .
is there a waiting list ?
there is a fun@@ nel , an a@@ eri@@ al part , a lam@@ p and c@@ loc@@ k@@ work key on the ar@@ k .
we have david atten@@ bor@@ ough .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
this is a serious business .
we have 11 and a half million r@@ oot ap@@ e@@ x and a total l@@ ength of 600 or more kilometers and a very high surface area .
they have electrical signals .
and so when i come back from these tri@@ ps , and i &apos;m thinking about development , and i &apos;m flying home and i &apos;m thinking ,
it &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
in tan@@ zan@@ ia and ug@@ anda , they represent 90 percent of co@@ ke &apos;s sal@@ es .
now the reason these micro-@@ entreprene@@ urs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pu@@ sh@@ car@@ t or their whe@@ el@@ bar@@ row .
&quot; wa@@ sh you hands , you might not get di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a . &quot;
but more importantly , it sa@@ ves lives .
on augu@@ st 14@@ th and 15@@ th , they took a st@@ ool sample , and by the 25@@ th of augu@@ st , it was con@@ fir@@ med he had type 1 polio .
and we are so close .
there are 300 nur@@ ses studying .
the failure points were the same : walls and sla@@ bs not ti@@ ed proper@@ ly into colum@@ ns -- that &apos;s a roof sla@@ b han@@ ging off the building -- can@@ ti@@ lever@@ ed structures , or structures that were as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tric ,
they ti@@ ed the re@@ bar right ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : nat@@ ali@@ e jer@@ em@@ ij@@ en@@ ko &apos;s unusual lab puts art to work , and addre@@ sses environmental wo@@ es by combin@@ ing engineering know@@ -@@ how with public art and a team of volunte@@ ers . these real-@@ life experiments include : walking ta@@ d@@ po@@ les , tex@@ ting &quot; fish , &quot; plan@@ ting fi@@ re-@@ hy@@ dr@@ ant gar@@ dens and more .
in this case , of course , the r@@ ound@@ about with that micro-@@ decisions being made in sit@@ u by people not being told what to do .
so it starts by building a better mou@@ se@@ tra@@ p , of course .
and that aggre@@ g@@ ating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
this was civi@@ c mobi@@ li@@ zation .
here &apos;s one of them that we have up now .
healthy sub-@@ popula@@ tions of birds , increasing bio@@ diversity generally .
but they also have a chel@@ ating agent in them .
it is the network ;
here &apos;s how the song goes .
i received and email and it said , &quot; hi , i &apos;m ray .
so here &apos;s a series of projects over the last few years where i &apos;ve been inspired by trying to figure out how to really fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate close connection .
z@@ f : so what i did was i took those vo@@ ic@@ e@@ ma@@ ils , and with their per@@ mission , conver@@ ted them to mp@@ 3@@ s
like , &quot; p@@ he@@ w , it &apos;s not him . &quot;
and i chose two people to be , and i asked them to send me descri@@ p@@ tions of how to act as them on facebook .
and then a few days later i sent her this .
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
i gave of my time and my money ,
but more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories i had heard before .
anyway , another interesting thing happened while i was there .
the fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
second thing that i &apos;ve learned is that lo@@ ans are a very interesting tool for connec@@ tivity .
so in short , it &apos;s a do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself tool for small businesses to raise these fun@@ ds .
for me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
smile . smile . open the mou@@ ths .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
you can continue to innov@@ ate and invent .
if you get a stom@@ ach ach@@ e , if you get a little bit blo@@ ated , was not the right food , was not the right coo@@ king manipu@@ lation or maybe other things went wrong .
it sen@@ ses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechan@@ ical means , because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on .
it actually takes the signal and changes it , and we continue , even &#91; though &#93; our eight signals would say , &quot; stop , enough .
if we add the matri@@ x , if we add the structure language , which we have to learn , when we learn it , then we can put it back ;
so i actually developed a pro@@ pos@@ al to go out with a car@@ go ship and two de@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed fishing tra@@ w@@ lers , a c@@ ran@@ e , a chi@@ pping machine and a col@@ d-@@ mol@@ ding machine .
whenever possible , refu@@ se sing@@ le-@@ use and disp@@ os@@ able pla@@ stics .
they say the print media is dying --
you know , these last two carto@@ ons -- i did them live during a conference in han@@ o@@ i .
you will not like it .
now , talk of a divi@@ ded place -- the country was cut in two .
i said , &quot; well , maybe we don &apos;t have time for this right now . &quot; &quot; another time . &quot;
and it worked .

can you believe it ?

and the ti@@ tle of my talk was therefore &quot; indian innovation from gand@@ hi to gand@@ hi@@ an engineering . &quot;
ou@@ ter so@@ cket made by using he@@ ated high-@@ den@@ sity pol@@ ye@@ th@@ yl@@ ene pi@@ p@@ es , rather than using he@@ ated she@@ ets .
ps@@ ori@@ as@@ is is very dre@@ ad@@ ful disease of the skin .
you can see before treatment and after treatment .
and there &apos;s a 25@@ -@@ dollar in@@ cu@@ b@@ ator giving that performance that had been created .
one day he took us out into the sun and tried to show us how to find the foc@@ al l@@ ength of a con@@ ve@@ x lens .
and currently i &apos;m president of global research al@@ li@@ ance ,
now fast forward to 19@@ 00 : half the world &apos;s people -- more than half -- still live in asia , but they &apos;re now making only a fif@@ th of the world &apos;s product .
we think in terms of war and inter@@ state war .
the te@@ ct@@ onic pl@@ ates of world politics were shif@@ ting .
that will be a measure of total economic size , but not of per capit@@ a income -- won &apos;t tell you about the comp@@ osi@@ tion of the economy .
many people argue that the 21st century is going to repe@@ at the 20th century ,
all these things that cross bor@@ ders outside the control of governments , there nobody &apos;s in charge .
so if one looks at the stat@@ e@@ ments that have been made about this , i am im@@ pressed that when h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton described the foreign policy of the obama administ@@ ration ,
re@@ stor@@ ative se@@ af@@ ood allows for an evol@@ ving and dynamic system and ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges our relationship with the ocean as a resource , sugge@@ sting that we engage to re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the ocean and to encourage its resi@@ li@@ ency .
the problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the waves .
there &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
shel@@ l@@ fish , mu@@ s@@ sels , o@@ y@@ sters , cl@@ ams , ti@@ lap@@ ia , ch@@ ar -- these were the common species .
i get the meat swe@@ ats .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 9@@ 9@@ 4 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
what damage &#91; does &#93; it actually inf@@ lic@@ t on the plant ?
here you see a typical cu@@ cu@@ mber lea@@ f that turned actually from green to black because of a black fun@@ g@@ us , s@@ oo@@ ty m@@ old , which is cover@@ ing it .
there is a whole wealth of other natural ene@@ mi@@ es and this is just the last example .
there are no g@@ mos -- gene@@ tically modi@@ fied organisms -- what@@ soe@@ ver .
but if we go , for example , to this place , sou@@ the@@ ast israel , the ara@@ va area above the great ri@@ ft valley , where the really top@@ -@@ no@@ tch -- the pe@@ ar@@ l of the isra@@ el@@ i agriculture is loc@@ ated , especially under green@@ house conditions , or under scre@@ en@@ house conditions -- if you drive all the way to eil@@ at , you see this just in the middle of the desert .
and thir@@ dly , also to increase awareness by the gro@@ wers to the potential of this industry .
i love video games .
now if we look at what &apos;s going on in someone &apos;s head when they are being engaged , two quite different processes are occur@@ ring .
simple game qu@@ est .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
so , you give people lots and lots of different tas@@ ks .
and two things really flow from this .
and i just want to end by sugge@@ sting a few ways in which these principles could fan out into the world .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 9@@ 9@@ 7 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
most of us have to trust that that happens correc@@ tly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correc@@ tly for all the vo@@ tes in the election .
so you let a pol@@ l station wor@@ ker scan your en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted vote .
i guess the story actually has to start maybe back in the the 196@@ 0s , when i was seven or eight years old , watching jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au docu@@ ment@@ aries on the living room floor with my mas@@ k and fli@@ p@@ pers on .
but the oce@@ an-@@ protected area is basically flat line until right about now -- it appears to be tic@@ king up .
there &apos;s actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land .
the pe@@ a@@ ks that don &apos;t come out of the water are the se@@ amoun@@ ts .
we as a world are fac@@ ed with a problem .
so if the united states remo@@ ves a million dollars &apos; worth of lo@@ b@@ sters from a reef , ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i gets 50,000 dollars .
they realized that this was a common cause that they had found with the conservation community .
and it was a bott@@ om@@ -up system , and that was very important with this work , from the bottom up to sec@@ ure this .
but in contrast to my evil tw@@ in who lu@@ sts after world domin@@ ation , my moti@@ ves are not sin@@ ist@@ er .
the more tar@@ ge@@ ted our interven@@ tions , the better .
now let &apos;s take a look at these mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous recei@@ vers up close .
so it seems that the only tra@@ it that survi@@ ves de@@ capit@@ ation is van@@ ity .
and the lo@@ gic of our experiment was simple .
based on everything we know about the mu@@ sh@@ room bodies , this makes perfect sense .

and then -- okay , this is where we get to the song -- kind of bri@@ d@@ ges the gap to the emotional .
♫ qui@@ et ♫ ♫ qui@@ et down , she said ♫ ♫ speak into the back of his head ♫ ♫ on the edge of the bed , i can see your blood flow ♫ ♫ i can see your ♫ ♫ cells grow ♫ ♫ hold still a@@ while ♫ ♫ don &apos;t sp@@ ill the wine ♫ ♫ i can see it all from here ♫ ♫ i can see ♫ ♫ oh , i ♫
it &apos;s down@@ to@@ w@@ ns becoming gh@@ ost to@@ w@@ ns . the brain dra@@ in -- where all of the most educ@@ ated and qu@@ ali@@ fied leave and never come back .
and only eight percent of the people in the county have a ba@@ chel@@ or &apos;s degree or higher .
we have an amazing advoc@@ ate in dr. zul@@ ling@@ er .
and the princip@@ al there is in love with this room .
and the only places to get wi@@ fi are in the school buildings , or at the bo@@ j@@ ang@@ les fri@@ ed chicken jo@@ int , which i find myself squ@@ at@@ ting outside of a lot .
so these are real visible projects that hopefully the students can point to and say , &quot; i built that , and i &apos;m proud of it . &quot;
because , when you z@@ oom out that far , you lose the ability to view people as humans .
and eth@@ ni@@ c conflic@@ ts in particular have been a near constant presence as a major international security threat .
the highest level of dea@@ ths on the bat@@ t@@ le@@ field was recorded between 199@@ 8 and 2001 , with about 8@@ 0,000 soldiers , poli@@ ce@@ men and re@@ bel@@ s killed every year .
but let &apos;s look at the good news again .
rather , local leaders commit@@ ted to re@@ vis@@ iting them later on .
leadership needs to be capable , determin@@ ed and vi@@ sion@@ ary in its commit@@ ment to peace .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : aar@@ on hu@@ ey &apos;s effort to photograph poverty in america led him to the p@@ ine ri@@ dge indian re@@ serv@@ ation , where the struggle of the n@@ ative la@@ ko@@ ta people -- app@@ alling , and lar@@ gely ignor@@ ed -- comp@@ el@@ led him to re@@ focus . five years of work later , his ha@@ un@@ ting photos inter@@ tw@@ ine with a sho@@ cking history lesson .
so let &apos;s look today at a set of photographs of a people who lost so that we could gain ,
the treat@@ y seemed to be a complete vic@@ tory for red cloud and the si@@ ou@@ x .
that cla@@ use was obviously ignor@@ ed .
with this event , a new era in n@@ ative american history began .
the inf@@ ant mortality rate is the highest on this continent and is about three times higher than the u.s. national average .
because for so long i &apos;ve been standing on the si@@ del@@ ines
we all love chocol@@ ate .
now , i didn &apos;t come here to de@@ press you about the state of the global supply chain .
this is off@@ sh@@ ore .
they don &apos;t own those fac@@ ili@@ ties .
you need a place where people can come together , sit down without fear of jud@@ gment , without rec@@ rimin@@ ation , to actually face the problem , agree on the problem and come up with solutions .
i &apos;ve been at this for 30 years , and in that time i &apos;ve seen the ability , the commit@@ ment , the will of government to do this dec@@ line , and i don &apos;t see them making a com@@ e@@ back right now .
the numbers just make you want to zone out .
so , i hope to convince you that complex doesn &apos;t always equal complicated .
so let &apos;s do it . so here we go for the first time ever , a world pre@@ mi@@ ere view of this sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti diagram as an or@@ dered network .
governments realize that it &apos;s a big deal for our econom@@ ies , but don &apos;t know how to fix it .
figure out your mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ges , being s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical of government statistics , those kinds of things --
instead , we ought to be using computers to do step three and using the students to spend much more effort on learning how to do steps one , two and four -- concep@@ tu@@ ali@@ zing problems , ap@@ pl@@ ying them , getting the teacher to run them through how to do that .
i still do a lot of that , main@@ ly for estim@@ ating .
but autom@@ ation in cars allowed that to separate , so driving is now a quite separate subject , so to speak , from engineering of the car or learning how to service it .
all back@@ wards .
i can &apos;t think of any other subject where that &apos;s recently been possible .
so one of the ro@@ ad@@ blocks we have in moving this agenda forward is exam@@ s .
and while we &apos;re about it , let &apos;s have a bit of fun , for us , for the students and for ted here .
or , as some people , especially acade@@ mic@@ s pre@@ fer , beauty is in the cultur@@ ally condi@@ tioned eye of the beh@@ older .
the peac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent tail is the most famous example of this .
isn &apos;t that ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ vely cultural ?
it &apos;s hard to gras@@ p , but it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and when i &apos;m on my bi@@ ke , i feel that i connect with the profound beauty of israel , and i feel that i &apos;m united with this country &apos;s history and bibli@@ cal law .
and i can &apos;t see myself going into a state prison in new jer@@ sey and making such a pro@@ position , but this being israel , the war@@ den somehow made it happen .
well , that &apos;s a problem because one way or another , you have to get this guy moving because it &apos;s getting dark soon and dangerous .
when i started this program four years ago , i had this original plan of creating a team of winning under@@ dogs .
and that &apos;s how they develop self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em .
and so , perspective and context and history play key ro@@ les in the way i plan my ri@@ des with the kids .
i ran away .
so if this gentle@@ man had had a ho@@ li@@ stic education , would he be sitting there ?
there isn &apos;t enough water .
no pe@@ tro@@ chemicals in the pa@@ vement .
the food is incredible .
the green school effect -- we don &apos;t know what it is .
and the bal@@ ine@@ se car@@ pen@@ ters want to be as modern as we do , so they use me@@ tal sc@@ af@@ fol@@ ding to build the bam@@ bo@@ o building
it &apos;s a place mar@@ ked on ancient maps as &quot; here be mon@@ sters . &quot;
what i &apos;d also like to con@@ ve@@ y is that it is not all d@@ oom and g@@ loo@@ m that we are seeing in the high se@@ as .
it &apos;s actually a bay .
so what i &apos;d really like to suggest is that we need to sc@@ al@@ e-@@ up .
we can stop the colli@@ sion course of 50 percent of the planet with the high se@@ as .
but i did go on to be a reas@@ on@@ ably a@@ stu@@ te , argu@@ ably worl@@ d-@@ class wor@@ ri@@ er .
in case you mis@@ sed it , we &apos;ll look again .
you guys may be familiar with this research that &apos;s coming out of the n@@ f@@ l .
it &apos;s a great place to start if you have questions .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 10@@ 13 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
we have only been discus@@ sing and consu@@ med with high-@@ level pre@@ occu@@ p@@ ations over tr@@ oo@@ p levels , dra@@ w@@ down ti@@ mel@@ ines , sur@@ ges and sting oper@@ ations , when we should be exam@@ ining the details of where the social fabri@@ c has been most tor@@ n , where the community has impro@@ vis@@ ed and survi@@ ved and shown acts of resi@@ li@@ ence and amazing coura@@ ge just to keep life going .
we are missing the stories of viol@@ et , who , despite survi@@ ving genocide in the church mass@@ ac@@ re , she kept on going on , bur@@ ying bodies , clean@@ ing homes , clean@@ ing the streets .
not one , but 50 percent .
ideas , language , even the phra@@ se &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot;
however , if you actually talk to people and even question yourself , and you ask yourself , where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?
and before you know it , it &apos;s 5 p@@ .@@ m@@ . ,
i think that sleep and work are very clos@@ ely related --
which is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , but that &apos;s one of the exc@@ uses that man@@ agers give .
now what &apos;s interesting is , if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work , like at home , in the car , on a plane , late at night , or early in the morning , you don &apos;t find man@@ agers and meet@@ ings . you find a lot of other di@@ str@@ actions , but not man@@ agers and meet@@ ings .
so one meeting tends to lead to another meeting , which leads to another meeting .
and what you &apos;ll find is that a tremendous amount of work gets done when no one talks to each other .
i hope that some of these ideas were at least pro@@ voc@@ ative enough for man@@ agers and bos@@ ses and business ow@@ ners and organi@@ zers and people who are in charge of other people , to think about la@@ ying off a little bit , and giving people more time to get work done .
everything in the kitchen was sal@@ va@@ ged .
so we changed that and put , &quot; this is the famous bud@@ we@@ is@@ er house .
so i can show you an object you &apos;ve never seen before .
and in there he said that cultures tend to s@@ wing between one of two perspec@@ tives .
the fourth thing is labor is di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately more expensive than materials .
now there &apos;s a bli@@ ght on the planet .
but you know what they did ? they hoo@@ ked a metaphor into it and said , &quot; i drink dr. pe@@ p@@ per ... &quot;
the last thing is gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ousness .
everybody points and laugh@@ s , and they say , &quot; he tried it a fif@@ th time and it still didn &apos;t work .
i came here today to talk about what &apos;s wrong with our food system .
they do this because they &apos;ve stri@@ pped the soil from all nutri@@ ents from growing the same cro@@ p over and over again .
not too long ago , my un@@ cle said that he off@@ ered my si@@ x-@@ year-old cou@@ s@@ in cer@@ e@@ al .
the second son took his third -- a third of 18 is six .
it may be one of our most ancient human her@@ ita@@ ges .
and as the saying goes , when an@@ gry , you will make the best speech you will ever re@@ gr@@ et .
just out of curi@@ osity , how many of you ?
but it &apos;s not just what he stood for , it &apos;s what his message was .
now if i were to come to you fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face and come this close to you , you would feel thre@@ aten@@ ed .
&quot; in the name of father i@@ bra@@ him , let me offer you some food . &quot;
they sit on the floor -- she doesn &apos;t even have a tab@@ lec@@ lo@@ th .
it was done in northern i@@ rel@@ and .
and so who of you ever ate insects ?
and not only in the states , but in any country , in any economy .
you &apos;re eating at least 500 gra@@ ms per year .
the human population is growing very rapidly
and you can easily do without anything .
if we take 10 kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms of food -- and it results in one kil@@ o@@ gram of be@@ ef , the other nine kil@@ o@@ gra@@ ms are waste , and a lot of that is man@@ ure .
on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side , you see a market in la@@ os where they have ab@@ un@@ dan@@ tly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
i predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the super@@ markets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and actually , our product -- what you see here .
then the animal lear@@ ns to walk on a le@@ as@@ h in the open and find tar@@ gets .
especially in africa where t@@ .@@ b@@ . and hiv are stron@@ g@@ ly lin@@ ked , there is a huge common problem .
can you imagine the potential off@@ spring applic@@ ations -- environmental dete@@ ction of pollu@@ tan@@ ts in so@@ ils , custom@@ s applic@@ ations , dete@@ ction of il@@ lic@@ it goods in con@@ tain@@ ers and so on .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 228293 &quot; &gt; sebastian betti &lt; / reviewer &gt;
the last stage is basically waste ,
right , here &apos;s a re@@ condi@@ tioned coffee machine .
a couple of wor@@ m@@ eri@@ es in there too .
and that &apos;s sof@@ tly moving that air current through the room .
i mean , the whole thing is is super@@ -@@ sustainable .
and i hope you all take part .
so we decided , a bit fe@@ d-@@ up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stom@@ ach that this wasn &apos;t sustainable , to found a financial services fir@@ m based on our values ,
it &apos;s the female trend , and it &apos;s the sustain@@ ability trend , that are going to create some of the most interesting investment opportunities in the years to come .
from work or from home , they took the day off , and nothing worked in ic@@ eland .
&lt; speaker &gt; ton@@ y por@@ ter &lt; / speaker &gt;
sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
now i expected him to say something like , i &apos;d be sad ; i &apos;d be mad ; i &apos;d be an@@ gry , or something like that .
they called me an@@ th@@ ony growing up as a kid .
she &apos;s what i know today to be men@@ tally ill , high@@ er-@@ function@@ ing at times than others .
we see that as an equ@@ ation that equ@@ als violence against women .
i &apos;m a product of this vi@@ sion@@ ary mother and father .
and the second thing , which has sta@@ yed with me , which became my philosoph@@ y of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad .
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
i didn &apos;t know how to look at them .
books came from don@@ ated school@@ books .
this is a concept which i introduced to listen to comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts , listen to gri@@ evan@@ ces .
not a lot of women did .
i first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago .
and basically what you &apos;ll see is what econom@@ ists talk about as the pol@@ ari@@ zation of the economy .
you would tell everyone below you what to do .
because i &apos;m writing a book about all this , i &apos;m still looking into it , so i don &apos;t have the answer .
so who were they ?
now because we haven &apos;t fully process@@ ed this information , it &apos;s kind of coming back to us in our pop culture in these kind of weird and ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated ways , where you can see that the stereo@@ types are changing .
there &apos;s no hole in the middle that you &apos;re going to fall through .
it was pur@@ ch@@ ased the year i was born ,
it was the@@ irs . it was experi@@ enti@@ al . it was auth@@ enti@@ c .
i teach at the science leadership acade@@ my , which is a partner@@ ship school between the fran@@ kl@@ in institute and the school district of phil@@ a@@ del@@ phi@@ a .
this was done in like two or three days .
we know how to do this better , and it &apos;s time to do better .
and we &apos;ve been surprised to find , as young parents , that there are almost more tab@@ oos around par@@ en@@ ting than there are around sex .
alis@@ a was very gener@@ ously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- -- and i was there with a cat@@ ch@@ er &apos;s mit@@ t .
and i think i &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
and i was really surprised by those feelings .
this is actually the last little image we have of him .
the party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten drama@@ tically better ever since i particip@@ ated in the mi@@ rac@@ le that is child@@ birth and family .
you start to realize that &quot; hey , i could go to this live music event and have an u@@ tter@@ ly trans@@ forming experience that will cover my entire body with go@@ os@@ e@@ bu@@ mp@@ s , but it &apos;s more likely that i &apos;ll feel cla@@ u@@ stro@@ pho@@ bi@@ c and i won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
r@@ g : and so this is what -- and we think that a lot of parents , when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your ba@@ gs for a trip to europe , and you &apos;re really excited to go .
now before we go on , i have a conf@@ es@@ sion to make .
what i find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our facebook network ,
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
it &apos;s a sche@@ me in the u.@@ k .
it &apos;s amazing that 4@@ 13 l@@ bs were lost just from the extra exercise .
in other words , i can trust him or her .
we &apos;ve seen over 2,000 kil@@ ls by these amazing animals .
we called her le@@ ga@@ de@@ ma , which means , &quot; light from the sky . &quot;
d@@ j : and of course , one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who dro@@ w@@ ns the vehicle gets to swi@@ m with the cro@@ co@@ di@@ les .
d@@ j : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a high@@ light of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hun@@ ting .
and so we , with the national geo@@ graphic , formed the big cat@@ s initi@@ ative to mar@@ ch forward into conservation , taking care of the big cat@@ s that we loved --
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we con@@ done .
b@@ j / d@@ j : thank you very much .
and i &apos;m in the meeting -- it &apos;s about a three-@@ hour meeting -- and two hours in , there needs to be that bi@@ o break , and everyone stands up , and the partner running the meeting starts looking really embar@@ ra@@ ssed .
so i &apos;m not saying that sta@@ ying in the work@@ force is the right thing for everyone .
and carri@@ e says , &quot; boy , i feel like i didn &apos;t really draw out the main point on the he@@ gel@@ ian dial@@ ec@@ tic . &quot;
there &apos;s a really good study that shows this really well .
i learned that i need to keep my hand up . &quot;
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
don &apos;t make decisions too far in advan@@ ce , particularly ones you &apos;re not even conscious you &apos;re making .
i find it interesting that , for every one dollar we spend , however , on early childhood education , like head start , we save 17 dollars on stuff like in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the future .
now ju@@ dy bon@@ ds is a coal min@@ er &apos;s daughter .
but the back of my t-@@ shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the en@@ danger@@ ed h@@ ill@@ bil@@ lies . &quot;
one problem : waste hand@@ ling and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment .
and imagine a national business model that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure to improve local economic st@@ ability .
but , like all of us , he had some problems .
since then , we got about 50 million dollars in stimul@@ us pac@@ k@@ age money to come and get here .
so i think what i &apos;ll do is just call you a story@@ tel@@ ler . &quot;
so i was very excited about this .
what under@@ pin@@ ned this shame , this &quot; i &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which , we all know that feeling : &quot; i &apos;m not blan@@ k enough . i &apos;m not th@@ in enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , promo@@ ted enough . &quot;
i have a sli@@ ght office supply addic@@ tion , but that &apos;s another talk . so i had a man@@ il@@ a fol@@ der , and i had a shar@@ p@@ ie , and i was like , what am i going to call this research ?
and it did . i call it a break@@ down ; my therap@@ ist calls it a spiritu@@ al a@@ wa@@ kening .
so she goes like this .
we live in a vulnerable world .
the more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulner@@ ably seen ... to love with our whole he@@ arts , even though there &apos;s no guar@@ an@@ te@@ e -- and that &apos;s really hard , and i can tell you as a par@@ ent , that &apos;s exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ at@@ ingly difficult -- to practice gra@@ titude and joy in those moments of ter@@ ror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; can i love you this much ?
and even as we do our own work , all too often , we find ourselves having to choose between doing what we think is the right thing and doing the expected thing , or the required thing , or the profit@@ able thing .
why ? because ban@@ kers are smart people .
a wise person knows when to b@@ end the rules .
and so she impro@@ vis@@ ed a sentence -- 11 months ,
second , don &apos;t waste your time on kids who can &apos;t pass the test no matter what you do .
if instead you re@@ ward doctors for doing fewer proce@@ du@@ res , they will do fewer .
under normal senten@@ cing proce@@ du@@ res , ju@@ dge rus@@ sell would have had little choice but to sentence pe@@ tt@@ eng@@ ill to serious ja@@ il@@ -@@ time as a drug fel@@ on .
they made sure that their lo@@ an reci@@ pi@@ ents were sta@@ ying up with their pay@@ ments .
rules and in@@ centi@@ ves don &apos;t tell you how to be a good friend , how to be a good par@@ ent , how to be a good sp@@ ou@@ se , or how to be a good doctor or a good law@@ yer or a good teacher .
because unfortunately for men , sleep de@@ priv@@ ation has become a vir@@ ility symbo@@ l .
since i live on a house@@ boat on the running stream of lake union , this makes perfect sense to me .
take the f@@ ati@@ ha@@ h , the seven@@ -@@ verse opening chap@@ ter that is the lor@@ d &apos;s pra@@ yer and the she@@ ma y@@ israel of islam combin@@ ed .
yet all there is in the original arab@@ ic is that one word : h@@ our@@ is .
and really try to grapp@@ le with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative .
and so it brings the second question : why should scientists study creativity ?
this is a short video of how we did this project .
in red is an area that active in the pre@@ front@@ al cortex , the front@@ al lo@@ be of the brain ,
he &apos;s in there . you can see his legs up there .
now when i think about impro@@ vis@@ ation and the language , well what &apos;s next ?
whether or not you like the music is ir@@ relevant .
&lt; speaker &gt; de@@ bor@@ ah r@@ ho@@ des &lt; / speaker &gt;
now everybody ru@@ shed to cri@@ tici@@ ze the task force , even though most of them weren &apos;t in anyway familiar with the mammo@@ graphy studies .
but imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
but it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
it &apos;s made not of a bul@@ ky tube , but of a th@@ in layer of a se@@ mic@@ on@@ duc@@ tor material that ser@@ ves as the gam@@ ma dete@@ ctor .
and the dete@@ ctor then trans@@ m@@ its the image to the computer .
it &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
of course we should .

i &apos;d love to just talk about each one brief@@ ly .
and being aware is just about reme@@ mber@@ ing that you saw everything you &apos;ve seen for the first time once , too . so there was a time when it was your first time ever hit@@ ting a str@@ ing of green lights on the way home from work .
so those are the three a &apos;s . for the clos@@ ing thought , i want to take you all the way back to my parents coming to canada .
he would say , &quot; look , can you believe they have a man@@ go here from mexico ?
we &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it .
i think of medi@@ tation .
it is all of those things .
i don &apos;t believe in the hope of change , unless we take action to make it so . &quot;
i &apos;ll tell you the quick story .
thank you .
now there &apos;s a reason why i study this , versus traditional anthrop@@ ology .
and he said one day , &quot; what &apos;s the shor@@ test distance between two points ? &quot;
and because of that , you start to dig around for your ex@@ tern@@ al memor@@ ies -- where did you leave them ?
so that &apos;s why i study cy@@ bor@@ g anthrop@@ ology .
and said , &quot; hi , i &apos;m trying to make a to@@ a@@ ster .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , i found a patent online for industrial fur@@ n@@ ac@@ es that use micro@@ waves ,
and ge@@ ologists have actually chri@@ sten@@ ed -- well , they &apos;re deb@@ ating whether to chri@@ sten -- the age that we &apos;re living in -- they &apos;re deb@@ ating whether to make it a new ge@@ ological e@@ po@@ ch called the anthro@@ po@@ cen@@ e , the age of man .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 612126 &quot; &gt; carolina montero &lt; / translator &gt;
and those color@@ ed glob@@ s are microbes that are actually swi@@ mming around in this room right now , all around us .
i &apos;m calling my initi@@ ative , &quot; take the other to lunch . &quot;
and since we had establi@@ shed some trust , we believed in each other &apos;s sin@@ cer@@ ity .
so i &apos;m here to tell you that we have a problem with boys , and it &apos;s a serious problem with boys .
nothing about that preven@@ ts us from paying attention to the liter@@ acy needs of our boys between ages three and 13 .
but here he stands as te@@ stam@@ ent to the fact that you can &apos;t rough@@ house on the play@@ ground today .
so that &apos;s the first reason : zero toler@@ ance poli@@ cies and the way they &apos;re lived out .
and if you ask ti@@ tle 1 teachers , they &apos;ll tell you they &apos;ve got about four or five boys for every girl that &apos;s in their program , in the ele@@ mentary gra@@ des .
they don &apos;t have the dep@@ th , the rich narrative that really enga@@ ging video games have , that the boys are really interested in .
it &apos;s very un@@ comfortable to be on the recei@@ ving end of that kind of language .
it &apos;s still working its way up the food chain .
more over@@ t , the bur@@ den of pro@@ ving that a practice is safe should not be plac@@ ed on the public that would be har@@ med , but rather on the industry that stands to profit .
all of the time .
it is this under@@ lying assump@@ tion of lim@@ it@@ less@@ ness that makes it possible to take the rec@@ kle@@ ss risks that we do .
so that means dr@@ il@@ ling for oil in the de@@ e@@ pest water , including the ic@@ y ar@@ c@@ tic se@@ as , where a clean@@ -up may simply be impossible .
the problem is that our ma@@ ster@@ -@@ narrative has an answer for that too .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 10@@ 5@@ 5 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
i come from color@@ a@@ do .
the pu@@ mp was a little bit proble@@ matic when performing , so i &apos;d att@@ ach it to my inner th@@ i@@ gh with the help of the gir@@ d@@ le and an ace ban@@ da@@ ge .
i fell through my apart@@ ment door and cra@@ w@@ led to the ba@@ th@@ room
i finally decided it was time to take my doctor &apos;s advice .
so my doctor got the ent , the top guy at the clin@@ ic , to come down and give me surgery to move the tu@@ bes around my voice box .
&#91; singing : french &#93; thank you .
it shor@@ tens the lives of the people who live there in the gul@@ f .
we feel so good about ourselves .
but guess what ?
but if we want to make something hard , we come up , &quot; i know , i &apos;m going to make a hard sub@@ stance .
we are passionate about resc@@ u@@ ing some dead materials from the land@@ fill , but sometimes not as passionate about resc@@ u@@ ing living beings , living people .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 10@@ 5@@ 7 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and the p@@ ile would then be 200 meters of phone books .
so this is where this little de@@ ar comes into play . this is my daughter .
that &apos;s where those arti@@ facts are coming from .
you can really see the details of the data set . it &apos;s very high-@@ re@@ solution ,
it really just works like a huge iphone .
so just looking at this heart , i can play back a video here .
these visu@@ ali@@ zations are brand new .
i can look inside of it .
some of the greatest innov@@ ations and develop@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ section of two fields .
it &apos;s just a robot .
he does not seem to be brea@@ thing .
there &apos;s a lot more to come .
now , i know it &apos;s a wi@@ de@@ spread assump@@ tion in the west that as countries moder@@ ni@@ ze , they also wester@@ ni@@ ze .
what we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that china is extremely diverse and very pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic , and in many ways very de@@ centr@@ alized .
well , basically the east was s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed by the west .
the problem with this pro@@ position is that the chinese state enjo@@ ys more le@@ giti@@ m@@ acy and more authority am@@ on@@ gst the chinese than is true with any western state .
and the state , of course , its authority flo@@ ws into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with --
what is happening is that , very rapidly in histor@@ ical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
so this is a solution to a situation where china &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
even doctors are patients at some point .
so i &apos;m going to talk about one experiment that a few den@@ ti@@ sts in connec@@ tic@@ ut coo@@ ked up about 30 years ago .
so the up@@ shot was this . the up@@ shot of this experiment was that fear was not really a primary driver of the behavior at all .
that path , that notion of a path -- that tends to work for behavior change .
and generally we do . these things are shown to be pretty effective in terms of getting people to slow down .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ t@@ mouth medical school , li@@ sa sch@@ war@@ tz and steven wol@@ os@@ h@@ in .
you ask tu@@ fte , and he would say , &quot; yes , this is the absolute worst presen@@ tation of information possible . &quot;
so that &apos;s our general blood work test .
last year , they made prof@@ its of over 700 million dollars and over 500 million dollars respec@@ tively .
i &apos;ve been talking today about lat@@ ent information , all this information that exists in the system that we &apos;re not putting to use .
and i just ate it up .
and then also my family was in chaos ,
and i think , i truly believe , that we can change this thing one lau@@ gh at a time .
so now i want to introduce you to my new hero in the global climate change war , and that is the ea@@ stern o@@ y@@ ster .
and one o@@ y@@ ster can fil@@ ter up to 50 gall@@ ons of water a day .
you can see in the diagram how it gro@@ ws over time from an infra@@ structur@@ al space into a new public urban space .
but we imagine , with our cal@@ cu@@ lations , that by 2050 , you might be able to sin@@ k your teeth into a go@@ wan@@ us o@@ y@@ ster .
appar@@ ently it can .
you know what those are , right ?
it was not something you &apos;d even re@@ mark upon .
but he also moved here to meet other people doing what he &apos;s doing .
and there are industrial ver@@ sions of this -- about 20@@ ,000 dollars .
well he did a little bit better than free .
and so the biz@@ ar@@ re result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tions about our demo@@ graph@@ ics .
they can make some educ@@ ated gu@@ ess@@ es .
why should i know this ?
she &apos;s 37 years old , she hasn &apos;t won a marath@@ on of any kind in eight years , and a few months previ@@ ously she almost died in child@@ birth .
when you have two out@@ li@@ ers in one organis@@ m , it &apos;s not a co@@ inci@@ dence .
austr@@ al@@ op@@ i@@ the@@ cus had a tiny little pe@@ a brain .
the u@@ ter@@ us would fall out , literally fall out of the body .
maybe we evolved as a hun@@ ting pack animal .
you can &apos;t be ha@@ ul@@ ing all your cra@@ p around , trying to ch@@ ase the an@@ tel@@ op@@ e .
that &apos;s because an ap@@ ach@@ e tri@@ ath@@ l@@ on used to be you &apos;d run 50 miles across the desert , engage in hand@@ -@@ to-@@ hand comb@@ at , ste@@ al a bunch of hor@@ ses and sla@@ p lea@@ ther for home .
i &apos;ve experienced it personally myself .
i will not m@@ our@@ n the dead with mur@@ der nor su@@ ici@@ de .
so i am going to read a poem that was ch@@ os@@ en just now .
i think now i never was pure .
pre@@ cip@@ ice running to and running from human beings .
i &apos;d like all of you to pau@@ se for a moment , you w@@ re@@ t@@ ched wea@@ kl@@ ings , and take stock of your mis@@ er@@ able existence .
if you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
medi@@ t@@ ate for half an hour .
because people say , &quot; bloo@@ dy hell mate , i haven &apos;t got time to get fit . you want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot;
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 228293 &quot; &gt; sebastian betti &lt; / reviewer &gt;
scientist : yeah , look , it &apos;s got a little blue light in it too .
where it &apos;s actually their ability to push our social bu@@ tt@@ ons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their function@@ ality .
the remote collabor@@ ator was an experimen@@ ter from our group
i could imagine grand@@ mothers being able to do soci@@ al-@@ pla@@ ys with their grand@@ da@@ ugh@@ ters , with their friends , and to be able to share all kinds of other activi@@ ties around the house , like sharing a bed@@ time story .
one case was the robot you saw there , au@@ tom .
so here &apos;s the first explor@@ ation of this idea , where characters can be physical or virtual , and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back .
but i can tell you , the thing that they love the most is the robot .
d@@ m : every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
we can do everything .
maybe i should become an histor@@ ian , or maybe a repor@@ ter .
they do everything for them .
the ne@@ ar@@ est we &apos;ve come is with ar@@ am@@ id fi@@ ber .
and to do that we had to find an alternative to glass , which is really very limited in terms of its unit si@@ zes .
and in their area they had a lot of shop@@ s and restaur@@ ants that were producing lots of food , car@@ d@@ board and plastic waste .
so the final project i want to talk about is the sahar@@ a forest project , which we &apos;re working on at the moment .
so inside it &apos;s cool and hu@@ mi@@ d , which means the plants need less water to grow .
some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the sal@@ ts .
and this is an important point .
and they had some , in my opini@@ on , terrible christ@@ mas music .
so what happened now is i &apos;m standing here in ro@@ tter@@ dam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and i &apos;m talking about wh@@ ist@@ ling .
oh , ha@@ h .
and i hope you &apos;ll come with me on my basic pre@@ mise that words matter , that they shape the way we understand ourselves , the way we inter@@ pr@@ et the world and the way we treat others .
and as they do that , they cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ate what they call &quot; curi@@ osity without assump@@ tions . &quot;
this is je@@ an van@@ ier .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical tools in a world lon@@ ging to bring compassion to ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant images of suffering that can otherwise over@@ wh@@ el@@ m us .
and by the look of that pa@@ unch , he hasn &apos;t been doing enough yo@@ ga .
so i will par@@ aph@@ ra@@ se einstein in clos@@ ing and say that humanity , the future of humanity , needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terri@@ fying and won@@ d@@ rou@@ s possibility of actually becoming one human race .
babies and children are geni@@ uses until they turn seven , and then there &apos;s a syste@@ matic dec@@ line .
the first is that the babies are listening inten@@ tly to us , and they &apos;re taking statistics as they listen to us talk --
what we did was exp@@ ose american babies during this period to mand@@ ar@@ in .
she &apos;s a si@@ x-@@ mon@@ ther .
and everywhere i &apos;m finding that i hear similar the@@ mes .
what is the cost of not trying ?
and one woman stood there with this perfect carri@@ age , her hands at her side , and she talked about the re@@ union of the 30 after the war
but that maybe it &apos;s not mon@@ sters so much , but the broken parts of ourselves , sa@@ d@@ ne@@ sses , secret shame ,
and they wanted to celebr@@ ate what &apos;s beautiful about ki@@ ber@@ a and ma@@ th@@ are -- the photo@@ journali@@ sts and the creati@@ ves , the gra@@ ff@@ iti artists , the teachers and the entreprene@@ urs .
for two years , he har@@ dly made any money , a tiny sti@@ p@@ end ,
who stood up for change during the civil rights movement in the united states .
and he said , &quot; so i conclu@@ de that , in many ways , leadership is like a pan@@ ic@@ le of ri@@ ce .
and so it &apos;s the pur@@ suit of better things , easily shared .
our ability to connect to each other -- most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are g@@ p@@ s-@@ enab@@ led and web@@ -@@ enab@@ led -- allows us to find each other and find things in time and space .
but they understood fundamen@@ tally that they are not a car company .
zi@@ p@@ car started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
and hon@@ est@@ ly , it &apos;s full of surpri@@ ses .
the cra@@ f@@ ty fo@@ x is this woman who &apos;s into cra@@ f@@ ts ,
and it gro@@ ws on a very regular daily basis .
so that &apos;s how it all started .
so it evolved .
and i really dedic@@ ated myself to that , both at the u.@@ n. and then as secre@@ t@@ ary of state .
but there &apos;s still so much violence , still so many problems , and yet we hear there are more women at the negoti@@ ating tab@@ les .
so if you have women in a variety of foreign policy po@@ sts , they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries .
in washington , the president of the united states is sitting in the o@@ val office , asse@@ ssing whether or not to stri@@ ke al q@@ a@@ eda in ye@@ men .
did you know that if you file your ta@@ x re@@ turns yourself , you &apos;re stati@@ stic@@ ally more likely to be fil@@ ing them correc@@ tly than if you get a ta@@ x ad@@ vis@@ er to do it for you ?
but it does mean per@@ si@@ sting in the face of their inevit@@ able an@@ no@@ y@@ ance when , for example , we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand .
because when it asked its staff , all its staff , to place their be@@ ts on whether they thought the store would open on time or not , a group from the finance department plac@@ ed all their chips on that not happening .
taking ri@@ ght-@@ ang@@ led ben@@ ds here and there , having th@@ in areas like the e@@ yel@@ ids , th@@ ick areas like the che@@ ek , different colors .
actually , sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the le@@ sion re@@ moved .
people know now that i &apos;m en@@ thu@@ si@@ a@@ stic , that i &apos;m a happy person . &quot; and that &apos;s the change that can be achie@@ ved for teen@@ agers .
this is a man in his 20@@ s
they &apos;re people who have their face shot off .
would we be happy if our doctor &apos;s face , our law@@ yer &apos;s face , our financial ad@@ vis@@ er &apos;s face was covered ?
we then put bone and tissue from the back .
i can put it in place where it &apos;s meant to be .
we &apos;re watching the ri@@ sing of the stars and the shif@@ ting of the ti@@ des .
these words , i hold onto all my life .
their achie@@ ve@@ ments , intellec@@ tually and scienti@@ fic@@ ally , are extraordinary , and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are ri@@ ding out stor@@ ms .
and this is what he said : &quot; the island is the can@@ o@@ e ; the can@@ o@@ e , the island . &quot;
and in particular , you &apos;ve probably all heard the analo@@ gy that the genome is like the blu@@ e@@ print of your body ,
it &apos;s the one theory that the biolo@@ gists ever really got right .
just like genome mix@@ es the study of all the genes , prote@@ om@@ ics is the study of all the prote@@ ins .
and so i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s look at it . &quot;
but we can see that stuff out there and actually see fe@@ atures of it .
and it &apos;s mi@@ rac@@ ul@@ ous in the case of infec@@ tious disease -- how well it works .
and it sounds sil@@ ly , but that &apos;s basically what we do .
but design a program of treat@@ ments specifically for you and help your body gu@@ ide back to health -- gu@@ ide your body back to health .
this was in the middle of the 20th century when music from the heart , beautiful music , wasn &apos;t the most popular thing in the cla@@ s@@ sical music world .
and for a moment i was wondering , are we going to live in order to see real change happening on the ground , a change that does not come through foreign interven@@ tion , through the mis@@ ery of occu@@ p@@ ation , through nations inva@@ ding our land and deep@@ ening the sense of inf@@ eri@@ ority sometimes ?
this is what they were telling . this is their pro@@ pag@@ anda .
and in our history , but at the same time , open to universal values , connected with the world , toler@@ ant to the outside .
if you switch off the cameras ton@@ ight , there will be a genocide .
we have covered a lot of trage@@ dies , a lot of problems , a lot of conflict zones , a lot of hot spo@@ ts in the region , because we were cen@@ tered at the middle of it .
thank you so much .
could art change the world ?
and then i saw it -- could it be possible ? -- my photo on a wall reve@@ aled by a bur@@ ning car -- a pa@@ sting i &apos;d done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there .
i decided to paste in eight isra@@ el@@ i and palest@@ ini@@ an cities and on both sides of the wall .
and i would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; so can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
three kids -- that was three students -- were &#91; deta@@ ined &#93; by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
you see that enough in the media .
some people question , &quot; why is it in black and white ?
okay , india .
for example , we did books -- not for s@@ ale -- that all the community would get .
that &apos;s rio .
and this starts right now .
everyone has done something .
plat@@ forms like youtube , twitter , facebook were helping us a lot because it basically gave us the im@@ pression that , &quot; wow , i &apos;m not alone .
he was a midd@@ le-@@ class guy .
this whole page was , again , managed by the people .
the next day i was in ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r .
the winning here is not the whole details of what &apos;s going to happen in the political scene .
most education funding -- whether it &apos;s k through 12 , or the great univer@@ si@@ ties or community colle@@ ges -- most of the money for those things is coming out of these state bud@@ gets .
how could you have a problem like this ?
they sell off the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es from to@@ bac@@ co .
technology has a role to play .
i &apos;m going to use my website to put up some things that will give the basic picture .
thank you .
the first auth@@ or , alex@@ is car@@ re@@ l , a no@@ bel prize win@@ ner .
this is actually a patient who &#91; was &#93; presen@@ ted with a de@@ ce@@ ased or@@ gan ,
we actually take a very small piece of the bla@@ dder from the patient -- less than half the size of a po@@ stage stam@@ p .
that was all new bone that was im@@ plan@@ ted using these techniques .
it takes about seven hours to print a kid@@ ney , so this is about three hours into it now .
i was able to be a normal kid with my friends .
l@@ m : most of my profess@@ ors were all for it , and they said , &quot; bring pictures and show me the cli@@ ps online , &quot; and &quot; i &apos;m happy for you . &quot;
so while other kids were watching sit@@ com@@ s and carto@@ ons , i was watching very es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic docu@@ ment@@ aries made by and about women .
so race , class , gender , ability , all of these things go into our experiences of what it means to be a woman .
thank you .
i wrote a book about eight incredible people all over this country doing social justice work .
but i think i was also getting my first lesson in activist work .
a galaxy . hey ! there &apos;s another galaxy . oh , look ! there &apos;s another galaxy .
the other thing that happened is -- i put them on youtube just -- i saw no reason to make it private , so i let other people watch it ,
but i was excited , so i kept going .
we &apos;re a no@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ profit --
do it as long as necessary , until you have ma@@ ster@@ y .
and so what i &apos;m showing you here , this is data from a pil@@ ot in the los al@@ to@@ s school district ,
the inner circle shows the videos they &apos;re focused on .
so once again , using technology , not just fli@@ pping the classroom , you &apos;re hu@@ mani@@ zing the classroom , i &apos;d argue , by a factor of five or 10 .
once again , i didn &apos;t expect it to be used in class@@ rooms .
do you think a lot of cla@@ sses next school year should try this thing out ?
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
it gives us a little bit of just@@ in bie@@ ber and a little bit of afghanistan .
because i think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dre@@ am@@ ed of it being .
so you &apos;re looking at a piece of what is by far the largest home video collection ever made .
he was an early tal@@ ker . and so we started to analy@@ ze why .
my son is leaving red in@@ k . i am leaving green in@@ k .
so we &apos;re using these structures to start predic@@ ting the order of language ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion , and that &apos;s on@@ going work now .
and if you put them on one pla@@ in , a second pla@@ in is where the content lives .
so , to sum@@ mari@@ ze , the idea is this : as our world becomes increasingly instru@@ mented and we have the cap@@ abilities to collect and connect the dots between what people are saying and the context they &apos;re saying it in , what &apos;s emerging is an ability to see new social structures and dynam@@ ics that have previ@@ ously not been seen .
can you do it ?
they &apos;re the ve@@ ins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty ve@@ ins .
there &apos;s a di@@ sin@@ cen@@ tive to con@@ serve , because , if you don &apos;t use your water right , you can lose your water right .
after all , it is their water right , and if they want to use that water right to help the fish grow in the stream , it &apos;s their right to do so .
we &apos;ve connected sen@@ ior water rights hol@@ ders with bre@@ wers in mont@@ ana , with ho@@ tels and te@@ a companies in or@@ eg@@ on and with high-@@ tech companies that use a lot of water in the sou@@ th@@ west .
and he &apos;s going into a din@@ er .
you can see it in the way we raise our young kids .
and then when they get old , they haven &apos;t really developed a philosoph@@ y of life , but they &apos;ve decided , &quot; i &apos;ve been successful at everything ; i &apos;m just not going to die . &quot;
and so reading and educ@@ ating your emotions is one of the central activi@@ ties of wisdom .
what it really takes to do well , to lead a meaningful life , are things that are deeper , things we don &apos;t really even have words for .
this is a gen@@ der@@ -@@ lin@@ ked tra@@ it , by the way .
and this is not an ability ; it &apos;s a drive and a motiv@@ ation .

but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
he thought nature would protect us from their forma@@ tion .
but even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
if it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too qui@@ et .
in this hu@@ bble image , we see two galaxies .
it &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a cha@@ o@@ tic r@@ inging .
there &apos;s a beautiful statement on the screen that says , &quot; light creates ambi@@ ance , light makes the feel of a space , and light is also the expression of structure . &quot;
as you can see here , there &apos;s some direct light on the floor , but they could easily figure out where that comes from .
to me , it is something from theater ,
and by modu@@ lat@@ ing the amount of blue in our environment , we can help people to rel@@ a@@ x , or to be al@@ ert , to fall as@@ le@@ ep , or to stay a@@ wake .
how do they share their culture ?
we can go further .
ed@@ ward hop@@ per was a real master in creating the nar@@ ration by working with light and dark .
and i &apos;m going to paint solar systems on the bac@@ ks of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say , &quot; oh , i know that like the back of my hand . &quot;
it can cru@@ mble so easily , but don &apos;t be afraid to stick your ton@@ gue out and taste it .
okay , so these are three things i know to be true .
never mind the fact that i was 14 . they told me , &quot; write about being 14 . &quot;
at a certain point , you would realize that someone has the exact same thing , or one thing very similar , to something on your list .
but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , i &apos;m ready to catch them .
i wonder@@ ed whether i &apos;d get to the end of this talk and finally have figured it all out , or not .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : what was the greatest invention of the industrial revolution ? hans ros@@ ling makes the case for the wash@@ ing machine . with new@@ ly designed graph@@ ics from g@@ ap@@ minder , ros@@ ling shows us the magic that pop@@ s up when economic growth and electricity turn a bor@@ ing wa@@ sh day into an intellectual day of reading .
and they live below the poverty line .
but when i lec@@ ture to environ@@ men@@ tal@@ l@@ y-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and wash@@ ing machines . &quot;
first , population growth .
but i can as@@ sure you that this woman in the fa@@ vel@@ a in rio , she wants a wash@@ ing machine .
&lt; / doc &gt;
this is a be@@ ef@@ al@@ o .
and by the way , the reason the kit@@ tens here are oran@@ ge and these are green is because that &apos;s a bi@@ ol@@ u@@ min@@ es@@ cent gene from coral , while this is from j@@ el@@ ly@@ fish .
and then , finally , the first cl@@ oned pig@@ lets : alex@@ is , ch@@ ist@@ a , car@@ re@@ l , jan@@ ie and do@@ t@@ c@@ om .

genetic engineering cou@@ ple@@ d with poly@@ mer phy@@ si@@ o@@ technology cou@@ ple@@ d with x@@ en@@ o@@ transplan@@ tation .
it conf@@ ers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the eth@@ ic@@ ists who are thinking about it and writing about it now .
so i closed my eyes , i took breath and the first thing that came up and out was &quot; su@@ mm@@ er@@ time , &quot; por@@ gy and be@@ ss .
it &apos;s &quot; aria , &quot; of john ca@@ ge .
how did those students get all that knowledge ?
but if you &apos;re not a n@@ ative speaker , you have to pass a test .

we can actually then light things up .
we &apos;ve had a mom in u@@ ta@@ h who used them with her kids , to a science research@@ er in the u.k. ,
and it &apos;s pain@@ ful enough now -- and i think it &apos;s designed this way -- it &apos;s pain@@ ful enough so you want to jump .
you do that because , 27 years before , an air@@ bor@@ ne ser@@ ge@@ ant had taught me to do that .
and i realized that , if they had to go into comb@@ at , they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .
they put a big screen up , and they take you through everything :
you probably think that the force that i led was all ste@@ el@@ y-@@ e@@ yed com@@ man@@ do@@ s with big k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le fi@@ sts carrying ex@@ o@@ tic weapons .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this isn &apos;t easy stuff .
perhaps something very nau@@ gh@@ ty .
it &apos;s a company that th@@ ri@@ ves on ide@@ alism .

it &apos;s like how can you not be inspired by those people -- your own co@@ workers ?
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
i found this to be true , both on the individual level and at a corpor@@ ate level .
and i took that driving lesson , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to learn how to drive . &quot;
so just like john@@ ny cas@@ h &apos;s sue , a boy given a girl &apos;s name , i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away .
and i &apos;m in one of the most competi@@ tive environments in the world , where you work hard , play hard , you go@@ tta be the best , you go@@ tta be the best .
but before i got to him , i was so lost .
and i went home , and , because the pain in my ch@@ est ach@@ ed so much , i thought , &quot; i &apos;ll go out for a run . &quot;
do something different . what do you want to be ? &quot;
i didn &apos;t speak hin@@ di . i &apos;d never been to india . hadn &apos;t a clu@@ e .

and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a for@@ ger .
these are real !
he was mostly interested in in@@ k ble@@ ach@@ ing .
but demand was ever@@ -@@ growing and it was difficult to tam@@ per with existing docu@@ ments .
in order to write the book , i asked my sister questions . i wanted to know who my father was , who was the father she had known .
there , just once , it happened in may of 196@@ 8 .
ro@@ ger e@@ bert : re@@ making my voice
i was using my i@@ po@@ d to play the leon@@ ard co@@ hen song &apos; i &apos;m your man &apos; for my doctors and nur@@ ses .
it knew things like the difference between an ex@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion point and a question mark .
so i sent them many hours of recor@@ dings of my voice , including several audi@@ o com@@ mentary trac@@ ks that i &apos;d made for movies on d@@ v@@ ds .
many blind people use them to read pages on the web to themselves .
this was a computer@@ -@@ assi@@ sted instruc@@ tion system , which in those days ran on a computer named il@@ li@@ a@@ c .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
ex@@ cu@@ se me .
re : wait . i have one more thing to add .
so let me tell you a story .
that &apos;s not only in the developing world .
but perhaps the most challen@@ ging part was to convince the regul@@ ators -- a matter which was deb@@ ated in the par@@ li@@ am@@ ent -- that a young female sur@@ geon be allowed the opportunity to pion@@ eer for her country .
and then transport these organs to the reci@@ pi@@ ent hospital and then gra@@ ft the gift of life to a reci@@ pi@@ ent the same af@@ tern@@ oon .
embr@@ y@@ onic stem cells have occu@@ pi@@ ed center stage , ch@@ ie@@ fly because of their plu@@ ri@@ poten@@ cy -- that is their ease in differ@@ enti@@ ating into a variety of different cell types .
and i had my vision re@@ stor@@ ed , but not before a pro@@ l@@ onge@@ d period of con@@ val@@ es@@ c@@ ence -- three months -- in a head down position .
each one has his story .
and back here in the united states , we saw economic desp@@ air , de@@ priv@@ ation .
can you imagine walking out of this building and seeing a tank sitting out there or a truck full of soldiers ?
let me help you with some things that you might be thinking .
you see people strugg@@ ling to get by .
once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly , pain and sor@@ row .
and you know that . americans don &apos;t read about this guy .
so people all over the middle east , not just in your country , are prote@@ sting .
so these guys , you see them .
so everyone &apos;s back in the room , okay .
now follow me on this , because i &apos;m taking a big risk here .
you &apos;re allowed to just hate them with every fi@@ ber of your being .

we go to meet@@ ings in the present ten@@ se ; we go on family vac@@ ations in the present ten@@ se ; we go to the pol@@ ls and vote in the present ten@@ se .
he just keep@@ s running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and reali@@ zes that he &apos;s in mid-@@ air .
so we just insi@@ st that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtu@@ ous and safe .
when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disa@@ gre@@ e with us , then we move on to a second assump@@ tion , which is that they &apos;re idi@@ o@@ ts .
i &apos;ve become the crazy w@@ ron@@ g@@ ness lady .
no off@@ en@@ se , but this entire conference is an un@@ belie@@ vable monu@@ ment to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
it feels like i &apos;ve land@@ ed in a col@@ ony of an@@ gels . &quot; it &apos;s a true feeling .
it could have been den@@ ti@@ stry , but the word &quot; experi@@ mental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for .
and the strange thing is , when i watch the film -- i have the eer@@ ie sens@@ ation of seeing it -- i saw myself literally dis@@ appear .
there are many people on this stage right now .
that &apos;s not all .
see , mr. hun@@ ter is doing that because he says his time has me@@ ssed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
we were all up@@ set with her , &quot; why are you doing this ?
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
this is about my friend bren@@ n@@ an .
and we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
i would like to talk today about what i think is one of the greatest ad@@ ven@@ tures human beings have embar@@ ked upon ,
so if you look at this p@@ ie ch@@ art , 9@@ 6 percent of the universe , at this point in our explor@@ ation of it , is un@@ known or not well understood .
and what the russi@@ ans are doing is they &apos;re building these dete@@ ctors and im@@ mer@@ sing them about a kilometer bene@@ ath the surface of the lake so that they can watch for these fla@@ shes of blue light .
i can tell you for a fact , that the next one that they &apos;re planning is called the extremely large telescope .
that &apos;s an american c@@ -@@ 17 car@@ go plane that fle@@ w us from new ze@@ al@@ and to mc@@ mur@@ do in antarctica .
here , they can &apos;t do it with the kind shoes they &apos;re wearing ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1@@ 13@@ 2 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and it &apos;ll dep@@ end on where we live , whether we live alone or have a family , how much cool stuff we have , how much we &apos;re willing to accept the risk of the@@ ft .
a lot of good experiments in this .
and there &apos;s some basic in@@ nu@@ mer@@ acy going on .
enough real world examples helps .
you don &apos;t need a model .
a lot of models come from science .
and those two things made the risk more than it was .
all examples of models changing .
i mean , this works as long as it &apos;s to correct others .
but in the long-term , both feeling and reality are important .
so it &apos;s important for us , those of us who design security , who look at security policy , or even look at public policy in ways that affect security . it &apos;s not just reality ; it &apos;s feeling and reality .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone shel@@ l , be@@ sides being nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; this is how to build an ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite material .
but what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
so i sta@@ yed up at night , and i talked to my husband ,
and so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite structures with nice link sc@@ ales .
my students promis@@ ed me it would work .
it &apos;s called &quot; our choice &quot; and the auth@@ or is al gore .
we can do the same for geo@@ ther@@ mal energy and solar power . this is one of my favor@@ ites .
&lt; / doc &gt;
well i took one year .
pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape tr@@ ap@@ e@@ zi@@ um .
you can play around with it .
and this is the pu@@ mp .
there have been six major research papers on this .
we made 3@@ 0,000 .
well before i go any further , this is something worth sharing .
and what you can do is just , if you give it a t@@ wi@@ r@@ l ,
and the third night , he would give it two more fol@@ ds -- and this is a very , very famous ca@@ p . if you &apos;ve seen any of our bol@@ lywood films ,

you might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
a high en@@ trop@@ y ar@@ ran@@ gement is one that there are many ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ments that look that way .
we want to know -- this is 50 years ago , &quot; sur@@ ely , &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;
mean@@ while , for all inten@@ ts and pur@@ poses , space looks fin@@ ite to us .
but if you &apos;re bol@@ t@@ z@@ mann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ations of those molecules will occa@@ sion@@ ally bring them into lower en@@ trop@@ y con@@ figu@@ ra@@ tions .
this scenario predic@@ ts that we should be a minim@@ al flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation .
and it cy@@ cles around all the different possible combin@@ ations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
my b@@ old spec@@ ula@@ tion is that i will be absolutely v@@ indic@@ ated by history .
it re@@ minds us that we are a part of nature , and we &apos;re not separate from it .
and always take time to smell the flo@@ wers , and let it fill you with beauty , and re@@ discover that sense of wonder .

and now its biggest threat is the dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ance of ice in the north because of the lives that we &apos;re leading in the south .
and they &apos;re also curi@@ ously aggre@@ ssive .
so i had such dry mouth -- probably not as bad as now -- but i had such , such dry mouth .

and so we mar@@ vel at sil@@ k wor@@ ms -- the sil@@ k wor@@ m you see here spin@@ ning its fi@@ ber .
so let me see .
or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some sil@@ k led t@@ att@@ oos .
so we &apos;ve made a sil@@ k card with pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in in it .
when i grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for super@@ powers , i decided instead to embar@@ k on a journey of real science , to find a more useful truth .
a recent study at u@@ pp@@ sal@@ a university in swe@@ den found that it &apos;s very difficult to fro@@ wn when looking at someone who s@@ miles .
a recent study at pen@@ n state university found that when you smile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more li@@ k@@ able and cour@@ te@@ ous , but you actually appear to be more compe@@ tent .
he was bra@@ sh , ir@@ re@@ ver@@ ent -- he was full of mach@@ o , a kind of mach@@ o one-@@ up@@ man@@ ship .
and without ski@@ pping a beat at all , he said , &quot; well , they &apos;d be about the same .
he really pop@@ ped their ball@@ oon .
and he said he had had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .
the only way it worked is when the hel@@ ium atoms were very , very far apart .
the only problem was that fe@@ yn@@ man dia@@ gra@@ ms are complicated .
but how should we honor fe@@ yn@@ man ?
let &apos;s make it concrete .
now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was gener@@ ated through the development of ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tic@@ als for treating brain dis@@ orders ,
that you can use to activ@@ ate , in animal models for example , in pre-@@ clinical studies , these neurons and to see what they do .
and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
and then we can try to do things in vi@@ vo that have only been done to-@@ date in a dish -- like high-@@ through@@ put scre@@ ening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen .
if you can del@@ e@@ te cells just for a few milli@@ seconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuit@@ s in which they &apos;re em@@ bed@@ ded .
are the cells going to toler@@ ate it ? will the immun@@ e system re@@ act ?
it &apos;s a si@@ x-@@ arm ma@@ ze . and there &apos;s a bit of water in the ma@@ ze to motiv@@ ate the mouse to move , or he &apos;ll just sit there .
je : which makes every imp@@ ul@@ se going through the brain a bin@@ ary code .
and this influ@@ enced me .
and so we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work .
it has a child running through a field , or something like that .
we won the competition , and it was pain@@ ful to get there .
so we realized we had to make a project that would be se@@ eds , some kind of seed ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al .
so that , even if you &apos;re parti@@ all@@ y-@@ si@@ gh@@ ted , that it was kind of cr@@ un@@ ch@@ y and so@@ ft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
so if we could ch@@ op that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property develop@@ er .

in fact , what happens is the neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters sp@@ ill out in three dimensions -- lat@@ er@@ ally , ver@@ tically , up and down in the spin@@ al cor@@ d -- and they start interac@@ ting with other ad@@ jac@@ ent cells .
the future hol@@ ds the promise that new drugs will be developed
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words ,
it &apos;s got a light or@@ gan under its eye .
this is a gol@@ den coral , a bush .
it &apos;s a green s@@ ab@@ er of light .
and i think this is actually a sh@@ ri@@ mp that &apos;s releas@@ ing its bi@@ ol@@ u@@ min@@ es@@ cent chemicals into the water .

this disease was terri@@ fying .
and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
so we are trying to wi@@ pe out this virus completely .
the vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
and then , by 199@@ 9 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to era@@ dic@@ ate had been completely era@@ dic@@ ated worldwide -- proof of concept .
u@@ ma@@ r was par@@ aly@@ zed for life .
which they put into the vaccine carri@@ ers of their vaccin@@ ators .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
so that very soon every child , every par@@ ent everywhere can also take for gran@@ ted a poli@@ o-@@ free life forever .
bg : well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their gener@@ osity up .
our artists are at risk .
so in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ide@@ ology of the country .
that iran was once a se@@ cu@@ lar society , and we had democracy , and this democracy was st@@ olen from us by the american government , by the british government .
and it &apos;s a great honor to be an ir@@ an@@ ian woman and an ir@@ an@@ ian artist , even if i have to oper@@ ate in the west only for now .
and i had to pay , order and eat at the male section .
maybe it &apos;s a middle ea@@ stern culture that became confu@@ sed with islam .
until very recently we used to have what i call se@@ cul@@ ar@@ ism police ,
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be lo@@ y@@ al to it .
and in place of that , what happens is that islam@@ ism gro@@ ws as an ide@@ ology which is auth@@ or@@ itarian , which is quite stri@@ dent , which is quite anti-@@ western ,
tur@@ key has never been colon@@ ized , so it rema@@ ined as an independent nation after the fall of the o@@ tt@@ om@@ an empi@@ re .
we are muslim belie@@ vers , but we want to be living as free people in free societies . &quot;
a blind person driving a vehicle sa@@ f@@ ely and indepen@@ den@@ tly was thought to be an impossible task , until now .
we have perception , compu@@ tation and non-@@ visual inter@@ faces .
and because you cannot see the vi@@ bra@@ tion , we actually put red led &apos;s on the driver so that you can see what &apos;s happening .
he &apos;s coming up to the grand@@ stand , fellow feder@@ ation@@ ists .
or for the blind , everyday home app@@ li@@ an@@ ces -- in the educ@@ ational setting , in the office setting .
you can see , there still is a little bit of a le@@ gi@@ bility problem there .
if i look at my own life ,
for which it would be hel@@ p@@ ful to know what it is that i actually do like to do .
in this case , &quot; keeping a di@@ ary suppor@@ ts personal development &quot; --
that &apos;s the kind of power i feel in this room .
we ga@@ ther together these physici@@ sts in los al@@ am@@ os to see what they &apos;ll build .
mil@@ l .
you were sleep@@ ing during that class .
what if there are tru@@ ths about justice , and you could just look around in this world and see which things particip@@ ated , par@@ took of that form of justice ?
the three people who vo@@ ted for mil@@ l before are familiar with this .
he said we should use our reason to figure out the rules by which we should gu@@ ide our conduc@@ t ,
it ar@@ is@@ es from not thinking . &quot;
find an artist or a writer -- or , hea@@ ven for@@ bi@@ d , find a philos@@ op@@ her and talk to them .
it is up to us to figure out what to do ,
i basically practice for finding money on the street .
and i guess you in@@ ject it into maybe an o@@ stri@@ ch eg@@ g , or something like that ,
and then we started the hell cre@@ ek project .
but we thought maybe -- well , we thought maybe that the material was breaking down after it was coming out of the ground .
so this is our problem , as you can imagine .
i guess we could make a g@@ low chicken .
arch@@ a@@ e@@ op@@ ter@@ y@@ x , which is a bird , a primi@@ tive bird , still has that very primi@@ tive hand .
thank you .
my first satis@@ fying sculp@@ ture was made in collaboration with these fis@@ her@@ men .
so we had to create one .
the sculp@@ ture could now be entirely so@@ ft , which made it so light it could tie in to existing buildings -- literally becoming part of the fabri@@ c of the city .

what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponenti@@ al technologies .
where you can pe@@ e on a little chip connected to your iphone and check yourself for an st@@ d .
oh , we might have mis@@ sed it , but using a.@@ i@@ . on top of radi@@ ology , we can find le@@ sions that were mis@@ sed before .
and these are being au@@ g@@ mented even by our devices again today .
probably in a few years , you &apos;ll check into your mirror and it &apos;s going to be diagnos@@ ing you .
and i think by lever@@ aging these sorts of technologies , we &apos;re going to change the definition of dis@@ ability to in some cases be super@@ ability , or super@@ -@@ enab@@ ling .
in fact , the whole era of laboratory medicine is completely changing .
geome@@ dic@@ ine : where you &apos;ve lived , what you &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to , can drama@@ tically affect your health .
we &apos;re now learning to identify the cancer stem cells and identify those as tar@@ gets and go for the long-term cure .
so in close , as you think about technology trends and how to impact health and medicine , we &apos;re enter@@ ing an era of mini@@ atu@@ ri@@ zation , de@@ centr@@ alization and person@@ alization .
for example , social factors .
it &apos;s not a con@@ spir@@ acy i have got against bul@@ g@@ aria . these are facts .
i can &apos;t tell you how many times i &apos;ve been sc@@ ol@@ ded in the park for le@@ tting my kids play on the ground .
and they said , &quot; ha . there won &apos;t be a single moment in the sche@@ du@@ le . &quot;
play : our brains are hard@@ wired for play .
really cool term : ne@@ o@@ ten@@ y -- the re@@ ten@@ tion of play and ju@@ ven@@ ile tra@@ its in adults .
imagine a world without theater , without the arts , without song , without dan@@ cing , without so@@ c@@ cer , without foot@@ ball , without la@@ ughter .
he &apos;s having fun , he &apos;s in the groo@@ ve , he &apos;s in the flow .
we had mar@@ gin@@ al profit -- i did .
you &apos;ve got to go back and say , &quot; hey , i &apos;m going to trust you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need a workers &apos; revolution .
and &quot; be@@ at@@ ja@@ zz@@ ers &quot; become as common as d@@ .@@ j@@ . &apos; s .
when comp@@ os@@ ers write music for me , i ask them to forget what they know about the cel@@ lo .
so my arti@@ stic practice is all about listening to the weird and wonderful no@@ is@@ es em@@ it@@ ted by the ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent cele@@ sti@@ al objects that make up our universe .
it was a solar wind interac@@ ting with our i@@ on@@ osp@@ here that he was listening to --

here &apos;s an example of one of these objects .
so what were these used for ?
and fur@@ ther@@ more , we don &apos;t even know what language they spoke .
and so they had to cra@@ m the sign .
so we could deli@@ ber@@ ately er@@ ase some symb@@ ol@@ s , and we can ask it to predict the missing symb@@ ol@@ s .
and interest@@ ingly , we also find the dna sequence from the human genome and instru@@ mental music .
why is that the case ?
you could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a lea@@ f -- and that &apos;s &quot; belief , &quot; right .
today , we can write a word such as ted in egyp@@ ti@@ an hier@@ o@@ g@@ ly@@ ph@@ ics and in c@@ un@@ ei@@ form script , because both of these were deci@@ pher@@ ed in the 19@@ th century .
and it &apos;s lar@@ gely what you would find in these books .
because with that beautiful photo , maybe i can also pac@@ k@@ age this little box here that talks about how ste@@ aming and bo@@ iling actually take different amoun@@ ts of time .
most of the time is kind of sitting there .
like for the ha@@ mb@@ ur@@ ger , we just cut the dam@@ n bar@@ be@@ cu@@ e .
as you move side to side , it moves off .
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that pop@@ cor@@ n .
and the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
these are the an@@ thers of a li@@ ly , cle@@ ver@@ ly done
if you look at the every@@ -@@ hom@@ e-@@ shoul@@ d-@@ ha@@ ve-@@ one scan@@ ning electro@@ n micros@@ cope picture , you can see that there are actually some patter@@ ning there , which is three-@@ dimensional .
i don &apos;t know what a dead horse actually smel@@ ls like , but this one probably smel@@ ls pretty much like it .
now wouldn &apos;t you know it , there &apos;s some beet@@ les that just love to make love at that temperature .
and i love the idea of something hidden .
this is a police photo . that &apos;s actually my car .
it &apos;s a cu@@ pu@@ le that took 40 to 50,000 blo@@ ws with a stone tool to create , and it &apos;s the first known expression of art on the planet .
if you look at some of these other it@@ em@@ s -- conc@@ us@@ sions .
neurolo@@ gical damage , 10 years of re@@ ha@@ b , requires a long-term perspective .
and then i cre@@ ep up to the point that i get a score of 7@@ 9 , which is just below average .
two elements that worked for me here are -- the first is 90 percent , i learned , of head and ne@@ ck pain is through mu@@ scul@@ ar-@@ skelet@@ al im@@ balance .
using this technology , the speciali@@ sts at u@@ cl@@ a medical center were able to identify where that com@@ pression in the h@@ ose pi@@ pe was occur@@ ring .
a radio device is control@@ ling every step i take ,
si@@ mon le@@ w@@ is : i knew when i was ti@@ ming this that there wouldn &apos;t be time for me to do anything about -- well this is it . this is the control unit .

now in china , you have the &quot; great fire@@ wall , &quot; as it &apos;s well-@@ known , that blocks facebook and twitter and now google + and many of the other over@@ se@@ as web@@ sites .
how do you hold the s@@ over@@ eig@@ ns of cyber@@ space accoun@@ table to the public interest when most ceo &apos;s argue that their main o@@ bli@@ g@@ ation is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze sh@@ are@@ hol@@ der profit ?
each and every one of us has a v@@ ital part to play in building the kind of world in which government and technology serve the world &apos;s people and not the other way around .

there is no equivalent of the al-@@ q@@ a@@ eda , without the terrorism , for democracy across mu@@ slim@@ -@@ majority societies .
when talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain pre@@ concep@@ tions .
but to get to that stage , where democracy buil@@ ds the fabri@@ c of society and the political choices within that fabri@@ c , but are certainly not the@@ o@@ cra@@ tic and military dict@@ at@@ or@@ ship -- i@@ .@@ e@@ . you &apos;re vo@@ ting in a democracy , in an existing democracy , and that democracy is not mer@@ ely one of the choices at the bal@@ lot box . to get to that stage , we gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely need to start building demand
tim har@@ ford : trial , er@@ ror and the god complex
he gives half of them vit@@ am@@ in c@@ . he gives half of them vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 .
and doctors suff@@ er from the god complex a lot .
and what we learned is ce@@ sa@@ r &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
we clearly can .
it turns out to be very important .
it &apos;s far higher than the failure rate of , say , americans .
we &apos;ll get rid of the ones that don &apos;t . &quot; --
shu@@ t it down at once . &quot;
but it was always a con@@ jec@@ ture .
so many people are there .
na : well , let me first war@@ n you that i &apos;m not the traditional ye@@ men@@ i girl .
it was very hard , you know , to imp@@ ose my authority .
so the other face of ye@@ men is actually one that lies behind the ve@@ il ,
it &apos;s very important for you to go to ye@@ men@@ ti@@ me@@ s@@ .com , and it &apos;s very important to listen to our voice .
we may not be that many , but if we are promo@@ ted as a good , positive example , there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again , coming to the bridge -- between ye@@ men and the world and telling first about recogni@@ tion and then about communication and compassion .
i &apos;ve spent my career fighting these problems .
and i kno@@ cked on the door .
today , they are no longer being written by ho@@ bb@@ y@@ ists and teen@@ agers .
and that &apos;s the name of the ow@@ ner of the card .
using the fact that we don &apos;t have the cap@@ ability to glob@@ ally police oper@@ ations like this .
so obviously i goo@@ g@@ led for it .
and even if we are able to find online crimin@@ als , quite often there is no outcome .
think about all the services we have online .
and the journey to that place of understanding and accep@@ t@@ ance has been an interesting one for me , and it &apos;s given me an insight into the whole notion of self ,
my dad is white from cor@@ n@@ wall , and my mom is black from zi@@ mb@@ ab@@ we .
i could be in the movement in a way that i wasn &apos;t able to be in my real life , in myself .
my desire to dis@@ appear was still very powerful .
i always wonder@@ ed why i could feel others &apos; pain so deeply , why i could recognize the somebody in the nobody .
let &apos;s not be fre@@ a@@ ked out by our b@@ oun@@ ti@@ ful no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness .
and it &apos;s with those teeth that i want to pro@@ pose today that we re@@ think a little bit about the role of con@@ temporary math -- not just financial math , but math in general .
and i said , &quot; oh . &quot;
and we &apos;ve lost the sense of what &apos;s actually happening in this world that we &apos;ve made .
but the diffic@@ ul@@ ty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects pra@@ g@@ matic chaos has .
and it uses what &apos;s called a bin@@ -@@ pac@@ king algorith@@ m .
these guys down on wall street , mar@@ co pol@@ o and ch@@ ero@@ ke@@ e nation , they &apos;re eight micros@@ econ@@ ds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hol@@ lo@@ wed out up around the carri@@ er hotel .

in the words of president obama , &quot; if the taliban take over again , they will inv@@ ite back al-@@ q@@ a@@ eda , who will try to kill as many of our people as they possibly can . &quot;
today , there are 14 health clin@@ ics in that area alone .
so the idea that we de@@ plo@@ yed the tr@@ oo@@ ps to respond to the taliban insur@@ gen@@ cy is mista@@ ken .
they &apos;re worried , in other words , that if anybody belie@@ ves that it wasn &apos;t such a threat -- ox@@ fa@@ m , save the children wouldn &apos;t get the money to build their hospitals and schools .
this doesn &apos;t mean that interven@@ tion around the world is a disaster .

&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1@@ 19@@ 7 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
so here &apos;s the problem : this is what we all want .
that is , you ask any gen@@ eric question about this -- how many trees of a given size , how many bran@@ ches of a given size does a tree have , how many leaves , what is the energy flo@@ wing through each bran@@ ch , what is the size of the can@@ op@@ y , what is its growth , what is its mortality ?
very , very bad for econom@@ ies and companies and cities in our present paradig@@ m .
there is an extraordinary regul@@ ar@@ ity .
there is an economy of scale .
what is the reason for this ?
and it &apos;s de@@ st@@ ined to collap@@ se for many reasons -- kind of mal@@ thu@@ si@@ an reasons -- that you run out of resources .
that &apos;s what we like , ho@@ c@@ key stic@@ ks .
hit@@ ler had two of them , and he didn &apos;t have any .
according to his bio@@ grapher , &quot; he looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world . &quot;
would you eat this ?
but how attrac@@ tive you find them , how sexu@@ ally or roman@@ tically moved you are by them , re@@ sts cri@@ tically on who you think you &apos;re looking at .
the golf clu@@ bs were ow@@ ned by john f@@ . ken@@ ne@@ dy and sold for three-@@ quar@@ ters of a million dollars at au@@ ction .
that &apos;s not because , or it &apos;s not simply because , i &apos;m a sno@@ b and want to bo@@ ast about having an original .
the question is : how much would people like jos@@ hu@@ a bell , the music of jos@@ hu@@ a bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to jos@@ hu@@ a bell ?
the first sho@@ ck is recorded as very pain@@ ful .
because one cup of food a day changes fab@@ ian &apos;s life completely .
but it never struc@@ k me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nur@@ se her baby , and she had no milk to nur@@ se .
and we can see brain volu@@ mes up to 40 percent less in these children .
and this is made with chic@@ k@@ pe@@ as , dri@@ ed milk and a h@@ ost of vit@@ am@@ ins , mat@@ ched to exactly what the brain needs .
or if they get an extra ration of food at the end of the week -- it costs about 50 cents -- will keep a girl in school , and they &apos;ll give birth to a health@@ ier child , because the mal@@ nutri@@ tion is sent generation to generation .
we &apos;re seeing that now in the hor@@ n of africa where food pri@@ ces are up 24@@ 0 percent in some areas over last year .
and they require that a third of that food come from the sm@@ alle@@ st farmers who would have no opportunity .
and we want to tell our grand@@ children that there was a terrible time in history where up to a third of the children had brains and bodies that were stun@@ ted , but that exists no more .
these fil@@ ters take us from all sound down to what we pay attention to .
and the art of conversation is being replac@@ ed -- danger@@ ously , i think -- by personal broad@@ ca@@ sting .
it &apos;s about enjo@@ ying mun@@ dan@@ e sounds .
now sound is my passion , it &apos;s my life .
and what mil@@ ler did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shor@@ tly after he died .
so what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be po@@ sted to facebook after you die .
har@@ ald h@@ aas : wirel@@ ess data from every light bul@@ b
then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent .
i compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum .
what we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can fur@@ ther@@ more replace the remote control of our light bul@@ b .
but let me do this .
you need to see what to do .
cars have le@@ d-@@ based head@@ lights , le@@ d-@@ based back lights ,
i &apos;m talking about your language , of course , because it allows you to im@@ plant a thought from your mind directly into someone else &apos;s mind ,
now the reason the chimpan@@ ze@@ es don &apos;t do that is that they lack what psycholo@@ gists and anthrop@@ ologists call social learning .
and this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cultural adap@@ tation , as anthrop@@ ologists call this accu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bu@@ st@@ ling and te@@ em@@ ing everyday lives .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooper@@ ate am@@ on@@ gst others .
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooper@@ ate to have a pros@@ per@@ ity that we couldn &apos;t have before we ac@@ qui@@ red it .
and it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can encoun@@ ter a new language in under a mile .
and that question is whether in this modern , glob@@ alized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
what we know about this fo@@ x@@ p@@ 2 and ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als is that they may have had fine motor control of their mou@@ ths -- who knows .
and we also sam@@ ple@@ d the out@@ door air .
thank you .
i never had babies because heads cannot give birth .
i heard people mur@@ mu@@ r from time to time that i should love my body , so i learned how to do this .
and i heard stories that sh@@ at@@ tered all the other stories .
now i make a daily pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to visit a particular we@@ ep@@ ing wil@@ low by the se@@ ine , and i hun@@ ger for the green fields in the bush outside bu@@ ka@@ v@@ u .
and the other women arrived and they sat in a circle , and micha@@ ela ba@@ th@@ ed my head with the sac@@ red water .
it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for , because i know this struggle isn &apos;t my own .
two-@@ thir@@ ds of all students in special ed@@ . re@@ medi@@ al programs are guys .
drugs , you want more of the same -- different .
climate change is already a heavy topic , and it &apos;s getting hea@@ vier because we &apos;re understanding that we need to do more than we are .
we go out there and we h@@ op in our cars and we drive from place to place .
some of it is about walking . it &apos;s not all perfect yet .
which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be he@@ ated with a fur@@ n@@ ace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .

the local se@@ ab@@ ir@@ d resc@@ ue center , named san@@ c@@ co@@ b , immediately launched a massive resc@@ ue oper@@ ation ,

so what happened to those 20@@ ,000 o@@ iled pengu@@ ins ?
and the two main thre@@ ats to pengu@@ ins today are over@@ fishing and global warming .
maybe i could become a film@@ maker .
and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my grand@@ dad &apos;s favorite number .
and that was kind of like the la@@ unch of this thing .
and it was an incredibly thing , working with the u.@@ n .
the world was never told there was a day of global c@@ ea@@ se@@ fire and non@@ violence .
and uni@@ ce@@ f , god b@@ less them , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;ll have a go . &quot;
so these guys were absolutely cruci@@ al .

we &apos;ve got resources at the moment in 17@@ 4 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global tru@@ ce .

what would happen then ? &quot;
another group that i thought their performance would be very low ,
and that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
and the genetic information is con@@ ta@@ ined in the form of a sequence of four bas@@ es ab@@ bre@@ vi@@ ated with the letters a , t , c and g .
this is surprising , of course , because in the order of six to eight times fewer people live in africa than outside africa .
maybe a single individual is mis@@ classi@@ fied or so .
and this then , in con@@ jun@@ ction with these metho@@ ds that allow very many dna molecules to be sequ@@ enced very rapidly , allowed us last year to present the first version of the ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al genome ,
a cave site in this mountain here , where arch@@ e@@ ologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last ph@@ al@@ an@@ x of a little fing@@ er of a pin@@ ky of a human .
they spread across africa also , of course , and there were older , earlier forms of humans there .
but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
isra@@ el@@ i activist : i was sure we were all going to die .
in a village called wal@@ la@@ je@@ h , which s@@ its very close to jer@@ us@@ al@@ em , the community was facing a very similar p@@ light to bu@@ dru@@ s .
&lt; / doc &gt;
we need some energy that &apos;s going to allow that to activ@@ ate , allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program .
and now it starts moving in three-@@ dimensional space -- so up or down .
we &apos;ll have sp@@ ati@@ al computing .
i was so privi@@ le@@ ged to be able to teach in a hosp@@ ice on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of ban@@ gal@@ ore .
they tou@@ ched me as well .
it is there within every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote on compassion ?
he &apos;s going down the path .
and the anthrop@@ ologist rand@@ all white has made a very interesting observ@@ ation : that if our ance@@ stors 40@@ ,000 years ago had been able to see what they had done , they wouldn &apos;t have really understood it .
and there was a very healthy sense of cau@@ tion , reflec@@ ted in the tree of knowledge , in p@@ and@@ ora &apos;s box , and especially in the my@@ th of pro@@ me@@ the@@ us that &apos;s been so important in recent metaph@@ ors about technology .
the pa@@ ige ty@@ pe@@ se@@ tter had 18@@ ,000 parts .
they were working on it indepen@@ den@@ tly , and they weren &apos;t getting anywhere .
unfortunately , our ability to model their long-term behavior , which has also been increasing , has been increasing only ari@@ th@@ me@@ tically .
and his discover@@ ies were really the beginning of the ger@@ m theory of disease .
so this is a start .
now if we answer those questions in re@@ verse order ,
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fu@@ sion is en@@ co@@ ded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
but what else is life character@@ ized by ?
the other thing we need to think about is the emergen@@ ce of chemical complexity .
so these things together give us evolution , perhaps .
does evolution control the sophistic@@ ation of matter in the universe ?
they &apos;re in@@ anim@@ ate , they &apos;re not alive .
because the thing is , we are so chau@@ vin@@ i@@ stic to biology ,

the picture there is k@@ h@@ ru@@ sh@@ che@@ v .
if i were to ask you , &quot; which are the two a@@ si@@ an countries ?
so exactly why did china grow so much faster ?
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
dynam@@ ically , it has changed over time to become less auth@@ or@@ itarian and more democratic .
in fact , if you compare india with the average developing country , even before the more recent period of acceler@@ ation of indian growth -- now india is growing between eight and nine percent -- even before this period , india was ran@@ ked fourth in terms of economic growth among emerging econom@@ ies .

chris anderson : okay , well that makes sense . thanks a lot mis@@ ha .

which is spread by a virus ,
this is jon@@ as .
we think that cancer cells actually come off the tumor , get into the s@@ ali@@ va .
so we &apos;ve seen that this can happen in animals .

and so when au@@ en@@ bru@@ gger became a physici@@ an , he began to do the same thing .

one had to do with a friend of mine who had a breast cancer ,
and i learned very early on with my first patient that i could not do justice to this very complicated patient with all the records they were bringing in a new patient visit of 45 minutes .
and they immediately said to me , &quot; well you are descri@@ bing a classi@@ c ritu@@ al . &quot; and they helped me understand that ritu@@ als are all about transformation .
and as i wonder@@ ed what he was up to , his stick fing@@ ers made their way up to his pa@@ j@@ ama shirt , fu@@ mb@@ ling with his bu@@ tt@@ ons .

it &apos;s not just about taking a p@@ ill , and your performance and your pain getting better .
which is u@@ sel@@ ess for a doctor like me trying to make a decision .
we need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective .
unfortunately , it turned out , that many of these trials were with@@ held .
so it &apos;s a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclu@@ sion .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : y@@ ang lan , a journalist and entrepr@@ en@@ eur who &apos;s been called &quot; the op@@ ra@@ h of china , &quot; off@@ ers insight into the next generation of young chinese citizens -- urban , connected and al@@ ert to in@@ justice .
i sum@@ mon@@ ed my coura@@ ge and po@@ ise and said , &quot; yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot;
how are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of china , or at large , the world ?
so through micro@@ blo@@ gging , we are able to understand chinese you@@ th even better .
last year , though , an app@@ alling inci@@ dent in a southern oe@@ m manufacturing comp@@ ound in china : 13 young workers in their late te@@ ens and early 20@@ s commit@@ ted su@@ ici@@ de , just one by one like cau@@ sing a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease .
we heard about pollu@@ ted air , pollu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ oned food .
so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
whereas now i &apos;m in the mid-@@ west , and it &apos;s cold .
well of course , you &apos;d go to en@@ cycl@@ ope@@ dia brit@@ an@@ ni@@ ca and open at l .
and , in my book , is in fact one of the first truly artificial living systems -- except for the fact that these programs didn &apos;t really grow in complexity .
can we measure this type of life ?
that is also very robu@@ st -- what you find in systems like earth where there are amin@@ o ac@@ ids , but there is no life .
so i &apos;m going to show you now a little experiment that we did .
and if you can do that , then you have life .
three times .
we &apos;ve got to clear the ar@@ ter@@ ies of our lives .
go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,@@ 500 to 1,000 .
think back when you were just a kid .
and these practic@@ es have significant economic and environmental implic@@ ations that we &apos;re already starting to see today .
people , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
it &apos;s the last major material to be rec@@ overed in any significant amount on the earth .
and it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recyc@@ ling .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last to@@ dd@@ ler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
i have to trust the or@@ che@@ str@@ a , and , even more cruci@@ ally , i have to trust myself .
we san@@ g , we san@@ g , we san@@ g , and ama@@ z@@ ingly new trust grew , and indeed friend@@ ship b@@ los@@ som@@ ed .
i &apos;ve got a little experiment i want to try with you .
charles ha@@ z@@ le@@ wood : yeah , you sound a bit more like co@@ ws really than human beings .
it was a really extraordinary moment .
ha@@ y@@ dn re@@ mon@@ str@@ ated with the prin@@ ce , but to no ava@@ il .
we wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
the question you might ask though is : why do children learn so much ?
by far than any other animal .
then they test that new hypothe@@ sis and so on and so forth .
but un@@ consci@@ ously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated cal@@ cu@@ lations that will give them a condi@@ tional prob@@ ability measure .
a@@ g : now this is his next idea .
so we have a very focused , pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ driven kind of attention .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and then somebody , i think it was b@@ m@@ w , introduced a light that went out slowly .
and when that happens , are you sitting there going , &quot; no , the movie &apos;s about to start , &quot; or are you going , &quot; that &apos;s fantastic . i &apos;m looking forward to it .
maybe there &apos;s an inno@@ c@@ ence to it .
po@@ ig@@ nan@@ cy is a word i love as a designer .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help me@@ dd@@ ling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
i can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
it &apos;s that easy to lose beauty , because beauty &apos;s incredibly difficult to do .
so we &apos;re going to have a little experiment .
it feels fantastic when you do it , you look forward to doing it , and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have -- you look really smart .
van@@ ne@@ v@@ ar bush was the u.s. government &apos;s ch@@ ief scientific ad@@ vis@@ er during the war . and in 19@@ 45 , he published an article in a magazine called atlan@@ tic mon@@ th@@ ly .
and in a pre@@ mon@@ i@@ tion of today &apos;s world of cloud computing and softw@@ ares of service , his system was called n@@ ls for on-@@ line system .
and our p@@ c version became quite mat@@ ure .
so that puts me in pretty illu@@ stri@@ ous company .

for example , if we &apos;d had tedx@@ par@@ is 3@@ 50 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive v@@ au@@ ban@@ -@@ style for@@ tific@@ ations -- and we could have predic@@ ted a period of st@@ ability in the world or in europe@@ . which was indeed the case in europe between 16@@ 50 and 17@@ 50 .
in this context , when you don &apos;t know if the potential ene@@ my is prepar@@ ing for defen@@ se or attack , and if the weapons give an advantage to attac@@ king , then this environment is most likely to spar@@ k a conflict .

it &apos;s not a lot different than the one you see on my patient .
and we &apos;ve had the opportunity to work with some very advanced arms that were fun@@ ded by the u.s. military , using these proto@@ types ,

and those little ha@@ sh mar@@ ks are where we put our an@@ ten@@ na@@ e , or electro@@ des .
this was one of our first patients , chris .

so of course , it took time , and i was nearly 40 , and i decided it &apos;s time to start as an artist .
so you can read &quot; architecture active &quot; or &quot; active architecture . &quot;
other ones are histor@@ ical .
it &apos;s two pan@@ els 13 f@@ t@@ . high .
so artist books , you take them off the wall .
so the techni@@ que , it &apos;s cut , sand@@ bla@@ sted , et@@ ched and prin@@ ted glass into architec@@ tur@@ al glass .
i created &quot; all around town . &quot; it is a pap@@ er@@ cu@@ tting , and then after , i added color on the computer .
so let me show you a little of that .
and so we &apos;re sitting there , and eventually after about an hour , hour and a half of just going back and forth , he says , &quot; okay , i have enough information here .
i know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
basically , what i decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that &apos;s cool .
at cor@@ e@@ ana super@@ market buying my k@@ im@@ ch@@ i because i like k@@ im@@ ch@@ i .
and then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all ,
so by me putting all this information out there , what i &apos;m basically telling you is i &apos;m telling you everything .
because it &apos;s about surveil@@ lance .
bg : on the day you are in a place where there is no cover@@ age , the f@@ bi gets crazy ?
i want to know if there &apos;s a chemistry of mor@@ ality .
so this experiment would have to cause a sur@@ ge of oxytoc@@ in , have to gra@@ b it fast and keep it cold .
the trick is you can &apos;t see them , you can &apos;t talk to them .
so we measu@@ red nine other molecules that interact with oxytoc@@ in , but they didn &apos;t have any effect .
it &apos;s empathy that makes us moral .
&quot; well this is very valuable .
so who are these people who manipul@@ ate our oxytoc@@ in systems ?
we don &apos;t need god or government telling us what to do .
so even though i have a fear of he@@ i@@ ghts , i recently str@@ apped myself to another human being and ste@@ pped out of an airplane at 12@@ ,000 ft .
let me show it to you .
we looked at the histor@@ ical at@@ temp@@ ts that had been out there and realized that , despite the fact that we have a lot of modern innov@@ ations to draw on today that weren &apos;t available previ@@ ously -- we have modern comp@@ os@@ ite materials , we have air@@ craft eng@@ ines that get good fuel economy and have better power@@ -@@ to-@@ rate ra@@ ti@@ os than have ever been available , we have glass cock@@ p@@ it a@@ vi@@ on@@ ics that bring the information you need to fly
for those of us that spend most of our lives on the ground , this may be counter@@ -@@ intui@@ tive ,
radio : what did you think of that ?
and the un@@ le@@ aded autom@@ o@@ tive fuel that we use is both che@@ aper and better for the environment than traditional av@@ gas .
if you think about this question for any l@@ ength of time , it &apos;s blin@@ d@@ ingly obvious why we have a brain .
and i think if ib@@ m &apos;s deep blue played anyone in this room , it would win every time .
it &apos;s a high school sport where you have 12 cu@@ ps you have to st@@ ack and un@@ st@@ ack against the clock in a pre@@ scri@@ bed order . and this is her getting the world record in real time .
now this noise is so great that society places a huge pre@@ mi@@ um on those of us who can reduce the consequences of noise .
and it has real beauty and real explan@@ atory power .
and mor@@ e@@ over , it prof@@ ound@@ ly changes your percep@@ tions by what you do .
well there &apos;s one very clear example where a sens@@ ation gener@@ ated by myself feels very different then if gener@@ ated by another person .
which started with one of them doing something to the other , the other re@@ tali@@ ating .
and if we look at what we start with , a quar@@ ter of a new@@ ton there , a number of turns , perfect would be that red line .
maybe we don &apos;t all quite move the same way .
but it &apos;s also relevant for disease and re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation .

okay .
really what i &apos;m talking about here is trying to create a kind of artificial life .
so we came up with this proto@@ cell model here that i &apos;m showing .
it re@@ con@@ figu@@ res itself and actually then is able to clim@@ b to the highest concentra@@ tion of food in that system and stop there .
but then something even more interesting happens .
they become very ener@@ ge@@ tic , and able to find the resource in the environment , similar to what we saw before .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 240535 &quot; &gt; clair han &lt; / translator &gt;
so my un@@ cle is only dealing with a mechan@@ ical interface .
and we were quite intri@@ gu@@ ed with playing with the notion of in@@ vi@@ sibility .
so i &apos;ll just show you an instance --
and so this object is constantly expand@@ ing and contrac@@ ting to create a dynamic with people moving around it -- almost like it were trying to con@@ ce@@ al a secret within its se@@ ams or something .
all of this happens in seconds .
this is actual 3d points with two to three milli@@ meter accur@@ acy .
let me close with another short story .
david .
so for example , they can see in the back part of the brain , which is just turning around there .
so let &apos;s take a deeper look .
this a place where the dead are brought in .
there &apos;s a bla@@ de here that &apos;s going to cut across a section of the tissue and trans@@ fer it to a micros@@ cope slide .
we take that ta@@ gged material and we put it on to something called a micro@@ ar@@ ray .
and remember that we &apos;ve as@@ sa@@ yed all the 25@@ ,000 genes in the genome and have all of that data available .
and so it &apos;s very important for those researchers that we &apos;ve created this resource .
those kinds of studies require much larger popula@@ tions .
and this is the first stop along the line .
a total of seven guys enter anony@@ m@@ ously in their under@@ wear .
looking at the entire fac@@ ade -- there were 70 total windows -- and i knew what i had to do .
there was also a 65 year-old man who particip@@ ated .
and it &apos;s a very de@@ pre@@ ssing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crow@@ ded .
and i think that &apos;s sort of the point of impro@@ v everywhere .

i don &apos;t have f@@ ea@@ thers .
and it &apos;s really like the kid playing the airplane .
my only instru@@ ments are an al@@ ti@@ meter and time .
bg : so the wings have their own parach@@ ute , and you have your two parach@@ u@@ tes .
and then i st@@ abili@@ ze ,
y@@ r : yes , with the final goal to take off , but with ini@@ tial speed .
and their parents , the kid &apos;s parents might have done some of these things when they were young , but not many parents have written app@@ s . where do you go to find out how to make an app ?
i &apos;m working with a third party company to make an app .
which is just about the size of a comm@@ a in a sentence .
this is what &apos;s really cool : it &apos;s aging more slowly .
so this is al@@ together really , really interesting .
it dama@@ ged the gene .
well when the da@@ f-@@ 2 recep@@ tor is active , then it tri@@ g@@ gers a series of events that prevent fo@@ x@@ o from getting into the nu@@ cle@@ us where the dna is .
just like we all have eyes , but some of us have blue eyes and some of us have brown eyes .
so i &apos;m really optimi@@ stic , and i think it won &apos;t be too long , i hope , before this a@@ ge-@@ old dream begins to come true .
and the 70 year-old ones , actually they &apos;re better at sc@@ ou@@ ting out the good ne@@ sting places , and they also have more pro@@ gen@@ y every year .

and the thought was , &quot; make it go away ! &quot;
that night in my apart@@ ment , after i got done kic@@ king myself and so forth , i lay in bed for a long time , and i thought about skin graf@@ ts .

your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
we don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
imagine you &apos;re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a . then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
so i posed this question to him : how can we get 100 million people translat@@ ing the web into every major language for free ? okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
then comes my favorite part of the question .
there &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
which is very surprising .
but the ma@@ gical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent any@@ ways learning the language .

if you de@@ vi@@ ate too much in the para@@ meters that are close to the mid@@ line of that life@@ -@@ per@@ mit@@ ting survival range , you go into disease or death .
there was a very interesting film , one of the rare good films done about a situation like this , by juli@@ an sch@@ na@@ bel some years ago about a patient that was in that condition .
and they are really coming out lar@@ gely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
so that &apos;s a very good reason beyond curi@@ osity to ju@@ sti@@ fy what we &apos;re doing , and to ju@@ sti@@ fy having some interest in what is going on in our brains .

there &apos;s now a ban on cat@@ ching them and even land@@ ing them and even land@@ ing ones that are caught acci@@ den@@ tally .
these are archi@@ val ta@@ gs .

outside ha@@ iti also , things were looking different .

this would put a pi@@ pel@@ ine to take natural gas from the beau@@ for@@ t sea through the heart of the third largest water@@ shed bas@@ in in the world , and the only one which is 95 percent in@@ t@@ act .
it &apos;s going to color our possibility to survive , and for our children to survive and have a rich future .
it doesn &apos;t , i agree , look very much .

in the world of the middle east at the moment , the deb@@ ates are , as you know , sh@@ r@@ ill .

now i &apos;ve taught you that battery science is stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward and the need for gri@@ d-@@ level stor@@ age is comp@@ el@@ ling , but the fact is that today there is simply no battery technology capable of meeting the dem@@ and@@ ing performance requi@@ re@@ ments of the gri@@ d -- nam@@ ely un@@ com@@ mon@@ ly high power , long service lifetime and super@@ -@@ low cost .
to the point that i became obse@@ ssed with inven@@ ting a battery that could capture this gigan@@ tic economy of scale .
no , i hi@@ re a student and men@@ tor him , teach him how to think about the problem , to see it from my perspective and then turn him lo@@ ose .

and for the next three years , her f@@ ate will be having sex with him every day , as a fa@@ vor for getting her in school .
she &apos;s at a place where she can &apos;t find money to go to school .
this young woman wis@@ h@@ ed also to go to school .
so what trou@@ b@@ les me is that i was at that place and somehow i &apos;m at this place , and i just don &apos;t want to be the only one at this place .

they have a lot of bio@@ diversity , a lot of carbon , things we want to protect .
at this rate , we &apos;ll reach 9 billion people by 20@@ 40 .
it gener@@ ates 30 % of green@@ house gas emissions .

i studied really hard in college , and i was proud to be one of the very few female computer science gradu@@ ates at my university .
and i thought -- that &apos;s it .
for instance , in the 196@@ 0s , india adop@@ ted very specific nu@@ m@@ eric tar@@ gets and they paid women to accept having an i@@ u@@ d plac@@ ed in their bodies .
and she expla@@ ined the income that she was getting out of her business af@@ for@@ ded her to be able to give an education to all three of her children .
when they make that change and that decision , those become swe@@ ep@@ ing regi@@ on@@ al and national trends .
we looked at it from top down and said we want to have different population numbers over time .
we &apos;re going to comm@@ it resources to it , and we &apos;re going to do planning from the bottom up with governments to make sure that women are educ@@ ated -- so that if they want the tool , they have it , and that they have lots of op@@ tions available either through their local healthcare wor@@ ker or their local community rural clin@@ ic .

and this dis@@ order is in direct contrast to the un@@ al@@ ter@@ able order of a bloo@@ d@@ line .

and i say most of us with fore@@ thought , as my four@@ -year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born .
now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why .
which takes me to part two : str@@ ing theory .
but over time the list grew as researchers found other can@@ di@@ date shapes .
we &apos;re used to physics giving us defini@@ tive explan@@ ations for the fe@@ atures we ob@@ serve .
and this gap was finally filled by an en@@ han@@ ced version of the big bang theory .
you see , we learned that our universe is not stati@@ c , that space is expand@@ ing , that that ex@@ pan@@ sion is spe@@ eding up and that there might be other univers@@ es
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
we had to beat the european mon@@ arch@@ y .
this is going to be the third largest park in rio by jun@@ e this year .
this is actually a station that we &apos;re doing in rio .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; v@@ ici@@ ous &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scen@@ es .
now it &apos;s 11 : 00 pm in rio .
and we cannot see that as a problem .
tex@@ ting has a 100 percent open rate .
kids are just sending us these text messages because tex@@ ting is so familiar and comfortable to them
this is really , to me , the power of tex@@ ting and the power of data .
the key , two words :
j@@ s : now , there &apos;s now a real fan@@ cy invention , it &apos;s the one where you wave your hand and it kic@@ ks it out .
maybe you think about the tra@@ g@@ ically bor@@ ing board games that hold us ho@@ stage in than@@ ks@@ giving situations .
and now i just got to talk about making as op@@ posed to making them .
so she said , &quot; we talked about the middle passa@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; but i &apos;d get to see them in america . &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
and the more i learned about the mexic@@ an culture -- my partner is mexic@@ an — the more i learned that , you know , for all of us , food is a basic need , but , and it is obviously with mexic@@ ans too , but it &apos;s much more than that .
and it &apos;s taught us really one thing , and that is to truly make good public space , you have to er@@ ase the distin@@ c@@ tions between architecture , ur@@ ban@@ ism , landscape , media design and so on .
but beyond exhi@@ b@@ iting con@@ temporary art , the hi@@ r@@ sh@@ hor@@ n will become a public for@@ um , a place of disc@@ our@@ se for issues around arts , culture , politics and policy .
so this is the big idea .
and so we argu@@ ed it on the mer@@ its of being a dom@@ e .
could be used for anything , for performan@@ ces , films , for instal@@ lations .
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , sec@@ ure , healthy and du@@ ra@@ ble .
mor@@ e@@ over , this transition needs no new inven@@ tions and no acts of congress and no new feder@@ al tax@@ es , mand@@ ate subsi@@ dies or laws and running washington gri@@ d@@ lock .
the resul@@ ting shift to electric auto@@ s is going to be as ga@@ me-@@ changing as shif@@ ting from ty@@ pe@@ writ@@ ers to the ga@@ ins in computers .
and combin@@ ed with tri@@ ple to qu@@ intu@@ ple efficiency air@@ planes , now on the drawing board , can save close to a trillion dollars .
and they also conver@@ ge the oil story with our second big story , saving electricity and then making it differently .
for example , pu@@ mp@@ s , the biggest use of mo@@ tors , move liqu@@ id through pi@@ p@@ es .
in contrast , the net addi@@ tions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity and the orders behind those keep fa@@ ding because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk .
at about the same cost as business as usual , this would ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze national security , custom@@ er choice , entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al opportunity and innovation .
but as ed@@ gar w@@ ool@@ ard , who used to chair du@@ pon@@ t , re@@ minds us , &quot; companies ham@@ per@@ ed by old thinking won &apos;t be a problem because , &quot; he said , &quot; they simply won &apos;t be around long-term . &quot;
do you see how there &apos;s three pe@@ a@@ ks to the yellow s@@ ine wave ?

it was like a really deep@@ -@@ down gu@@ t reaction , and i wanted to throw it out .
now don &apos;t get me wrong , i &apos;m not for one minute sugge@@ sting that sharing data is a bad thing .
i then go to a news site , look for some head@@ lines .

red traffic lights have a coun@@ t@@ down del@@ ay .
i pro@@ pose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn &apos;t even realize were problems at all .
it could really change things quite signific@@ antly .
and the idea that one of them should actually have pri@@ ority over the other is fundamen@@ tally wrong .
all of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car wa@@ shed or val@@ e@@ ted .
the problem with this is that then people expect women to be that easy to understand ,
and , actually , re@@ conc@@ iling all the contra@@ dic@@ tions i was feeling became easier once i understood that femin@@ ism was not a ru@@ le@@ book but a discussion , a conversation , a process ,

and he watched the ball fly for a second , and then he went , &quot; da@@ h da@@ dar@@ at@@ at@@ at@@ ah .
and in the 17@@ th century , it was more like this .
and by the 1@@ 40@@ 0s , music was being written that tried to mirror god &apos;s mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
and the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scor@@ es , the co@@ de@@ books of music , into the hands of per@@ form@@ ers everywhere .
at the same time technology , by taking over the role that no@@ tation had always played , shif@@ ted the balance within music between instin@@ ct and intelligence way over to the instin@@ c@@ tive side .
there &apos;s just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , per@@ form@@ ers -- to be explor@@ ers together .
that was the family business .
and started finding out that actually human beings as pri@@ mates have far smaller stom@@ ach@@ s than should be the size for our body weight and far larger brains .
because what i began to see then was there were so many different ways people would consu@@ me this .

there is nothing to eat up here , but the conditions were ide@@ al for hi@@ ber@@ nation .
now , the series hasn &apos;t even ai@@ red yet , so you &apos;re the very first to see this .
have a look .
it &apos;s inher@@ ently a feeling of being broken when you go through it .
and we had eight star@@ tu@@ ps sitting around there .
thank you .
and therefore , we set up various experiments .
it &apos;s to kill them when they &apos;re still in the water as lar@@ va@@ e .
and the answer i have right here in my po@@ cket , if i get it .
&lt; speaker &gt; tal@@ i shar@@ ot &lt; / speaker &gt;
but only 30 percent said that they thought families in general are doing better than a few generations ago .
it &apos;s quite wi@@ de@@ spread .
so why is that ? well if you get the k@@ is@@ s now , it &apos;s over and done with .
and maybe the most surprising benefit of optimis@@ m is health .
what i wanted to know was what was going on inside the human brain that preven@@ ted us from taking these war@@ ning signs personally .
we were quite ama@@ zed by these results because we were able to elimin@@ ate a deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted bi@@ as in humans .
but if you are an extreme optimi@@ stic pengu@@ in who just jump@@ s down blin@@ dly hop@@ ing for the best , you might find yourself in a bit of a me@@ ss when you hit the ground .
&quot; today i walk . yesterday i walked . &quot;
companies like google have di@@ giti@@ zed many of them --
how a teacher shu@@ t them down or how a student was particularly cru@@ el to them .
so he &apos;d take people to this two-@@ way mirror
so i thought one of the things i &apos;d do today is take you through and show you what this journey looks like .
so the quan@@ tit@@ ative results were great . but dou@@ g &apos;s results that he car@@ ed about were much more qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative .
and they just make better decisions .
and that &apos;s because today we can see what &apos;s inside of the brain , rather than just looking at its over@@ all shape .
but one of the most popular ones invol@@ ves green flu@@ or@@ es@@ cent protein .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 240535 &quot; &gt; clair han &lt; / translator &gt;
this one was from ha@@ iti .
and he &apos;s here also today .
these projects took thousands of actions in one year , making hundreds of thousands of people particip@@ ating , creating millions of vie@@ ws .
so obviously there &apos;s a massive hou@@ sing gap ,
but i &apos;m obse@@ ssive , so i couldn &apos;t just stop there ,
thank you .
so be@@ ij@@ er@@ in@@ ck set out to discover the cause of to@@ bac@@ co mos@@ a@@ ic disease .
and there &apos;s a lot of it .
&lt; speaker &gt; phili@@ p@@ pe pe@@ ti@@ t &lt; / speaker &gt;
now that manipu@@ lation was broken down into seven moves described over seven pages .
well i didn &apos;t think much of it at the time .
i get a pair of p@@ li@@ ers and some co@@ at han@@ gers , and i ga@@ ther them together in some kind of ro@@ pe@@ y path .
the mur@@ mu@@ r of the city di@@ ss@@ ol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chil@@ ling power i no longer feel .
so you don &apos;t want me to street ju@@ g@@ gle here , right ?
but the bird , instead of flying away , goes fl@@ op , fl@@ op , fl@@ op and lands on my head .
and he tells me , he has on his des@@ k a picture of me in the middle of the wire with a do@@ ve on my head .
but then something un@@ expected happened .
you know better than anyone that hiv brings out the best and the worst in humanity .
because stig@@ ma gives u@@ no@@ ff@@ ici@@ al licen@@ se to treat people living with hiv or those at greatest risk unlike other citizens .
but in order to do that we need to tac@@ k@@ le an epidemic of really bad law .
where you crimin@@ alize people living with hiv or those at greatest risk , you fuel the epidemic .
thank you .
and the computer models , no matter how many that you have and how many people that you use , are never going to be able to arri@@ ve at the same conclu@@ sions .
here we go .
but my dad didn &apos;t get the kind of robot he wanted , either .
he said , &quot; is the robot real ? &quot;
and people are watching her on their scre@@ ens ,
the idea is it allows the sur@@ geon to oper@@ ate comfor@@ t@@ ably in his own c@@ oor@@ din@@ ate frame .
so we &apos;re able to get a robot to perform a del@@ ic@@ ate task like a sur@@ gical sub@@ task , at 10 times the speed of a human .
also pe@@ a@@ ked , and they &apos;re now on the dec@@ line .
and maybe that makes you say , &quot; h@@ mm . maybe this isn &apos;t going to be quite so easy . &quot;
bottom right , bangla@@ desh has the same population den@@ sity as ba@@ h@@ rain but consu@@ mes 100 times less per person .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united king@@ dom with energy cro@@ ps , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
they all have a small power per unit area ,
so let &apos;s talk about three more big le@@ vers that could really help on the consumption side .
you gras@@ p it , you rot@@ ate it to the left , and your energy consumption in the home will de@@ cre@@ ase .
and if there is a le@@ ver you don &apos;t like the use of , well please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort on the other le@@ vers .
everything we know about archi@@ me@@ des as a mathema@@ tici@@ an we know about because of just three books ,
it got in worse condition in the 20th century after he@@ i@@ berg saw it .
and it &apos;s much tou@@ gh@@ er than the par@@ ch@@ ment that it was written on .
and it &apos;ll come out dark but red , and then you can start to read it rather clearly .
and this is the most powerful light source in the solar system .
hyper@@ id@@ es found himself on trial for tre@@ as@@ on .
and institutions can learn from this .
now , there is no need for these restri@@ c@@ tions at all .
it has nothing to do with the fact that i was born there , of course .
ei@@ gh@@ ty-@@ eight percent said moving toward greater democracy would help mu@@ sli@@ ms progress -- the highest percentage of any country we surve@@ yed .
what really changed after the ou@@ ster of mu@@ bar@@ ak wasn &apos;t that life got easier .
where women agree , however , is on their own role , and that it must be central and active .
and i don &apos;t know what you expect , but when i was thinking about that issue , i early on realized what i &apos;m not able to give you are answers .
the effects that you &apos;re having with the device , like less fuel , as well as the effects of the actual tools you &apos;re using to get people to do things -- public recogni@@ tion .
and that bi@@ as is that we &apos;re asking , is this or that &quot; still &quot; eth@@ ical ?
which is what pe@@ ter@@ -@@ paul verbe@@ ek , the du@@ tch philos@@ op@@ her of technology , says .
&quot; why should the lam@@ p or the house be an art object , but not our life ? &quot; as mi@@ ch@@ el fou@@ ca@@ ult puts it .
and when i tell people that at a cock@@ tail party , they usually
but dra@@ ke &apos;s idea here became very popular because it was very appe@@ aling — and i &apos;ll get back to that — and on the basis of this experiment , which didn &apos;t succe@@ ed , we have been doing se@@ ti ever since , not continu@@ ously , but ever since .
they &apos;re like , you know , kit@@ tens . you get a lit@@ ter .
nobody called . i was so nervous that i couldn &apos;t sit down . i just w@@ ander@@ ed around taking photos like this one , just for something to do .
that &apos;s interesting to cos@@ m@@ ologists .
ask the next 10 people you see on the streets , &quot; hey , do you think it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while to spend billions of s@@ wis@@ s fran@@ cs looking for the hig@@ gs bos@@ on ? &quot;

the idea that you have an identity that &apos;s given to you by someone , the government or whatever , and you have to stick with that identity and use it in all places , that &apos;s absolutely wrong .
if that message just comes from anybody , it has zero information value .

that &apos;s how big the difference is one species to another .
three different op@@ tions .
and one of the things you saw at ted about a year and a half ago was this guy .
what we do know is , potentially , the brain is reac@@ ting in a hyper@@ active , hyper@@ -@@ plastic way , and creating individuals that are like this .
i think we &apos;re transi@@ tion@@ ing into homo evolu@@ t@@ is that , for better or worse , is not just a hom@@ in@@ id that &apos;s conscious of his or her environment , it &apos;s a hom@@ in@@ id that &apos;s beginning to directly and deli@@ ber@@ ately control the evolution of its own species , of bacteria , of plants , of animals .
now i &apos;m sure as everyone in the audience already knows -- i did have to explain it to my nin@@ e-@@ year-old late last week -- pen@@ is@@ es are structures that trans@@ fer sper@@ m from one individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like this earth@@ wor@@ m , indeed most animals , don &apos;t support their tis@@ su@@ es by dr@@ ap@@ ing them over b@@ ones .
it had the central flu@@ id , it had the surr@@ ounding wall , and the re@@ in@@ for@@ cing fi@@ bers in the wall were ar@@ ran@@ ged in cros@@ sed hel@@ ices around the long ax@@ is of the skelet@@ on .
that &apos;s because we knew theore@@ tically that there was another way of ar@@ ran@@ ging fi@@ bers in a hydro@@ stati@@ c skelet@@ on , and that was with fi@@ bers at zero degrees and 90 degrees to the long ax@@ is of the structure .
&lt; speaker &gt; ter@@ ry moore &lt; / speaker &gt;
it &apos;s also the very first letter of the word sh@@ al@@ an , which means &quot; something &quot; just like the the english word &quot; something &quot; -- some un@@ defined , un@@ known thing .
and this attrac@@ ts met@@ als from their local environment .
imagine bacteria helping us do this by accu@@ mul@@ ating and pre@@ cip@@ it@@ ating and se@@ dimen@@ ting miner@@ als out of de@@ sal@@ in@@ ation br@@ ine .

and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life .
we can see moment by moment what children are enga@@ ging with .
it &apos;s very much like they brought into this world the re@@ fle@@ x that ori@@ ents them to people , but it has no tr@@ action .

and what i want to talk to you about today , and share with you , is that our healthcare system , our medical system , is just as bad at predic@@ ting what happens to people in it -- patients , others -- as those sc@@ ou@@ ts were at predic@@ ting what would happen to bil@@ ly be@@ an@@ e .
you have to have a high-@@ tech experience of pre@@ g@@ nan@@ cy , otherwise something might go wrong .
that &apos;s not very good for doctors &apos; business .
bil@@ ly be@@ an@@ e , by the way , learned the same thing . he learned , from watching this kid who he eventually hi@@ red , who was really successful for him , like the slu@@ g@@ gers do , which is what all the expensive teams like the y@@ an@@ ke@@ es like to -- they like to pick up those guys .
probably a form of sy@@ nes@@ the@@ sia .
nt : they wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
good even@@ ing .
it &apos;s again , sun in the day and high hu@@ mi@@ di@@ ty , and it was not comfortable .
out@@ door comfort . first of all ,
and they can enjoy and meet there with their families . and the same concept : sha@@ de against the sun , sha@@ de against the wind , and use , use and take advantage of the sun you can harve@@ st on your foot@@ print . and these beautiful um@@ br@@ el@@ las .
you know , my grand@@ father died many years ago when i was little , but his love for ma@@ e west lives on as a mis@@ spel@@ ling in the dna of his pro@@ gen@@ y . that for me is successful leg@@ acy . you know , as for me , my wife and i have our own crazy leg@@ acy project .
i &apos;ve started out@@ sour@@ cing my memory to the digital world ,
whole world to know about it .
education is great . it really teach@@ es us who we are , and helps us con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alize ourselves
between them , the two already per@@ va@@ de , as most of you here se@@ ated realize , every dimen@@ sion of human life .
here &apos;s how to rel@@ a@@ x your an@@ x@@ ie@@ ties , if you have them : understand that mathematics is a language ru@@ led like other verb@@ al languages , or like verb@@ al language generally , by its own gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r and system of lo@@ gic .
ju@@ dge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
this first of the two strate@@ gies is like a hun@@ ter , explor@@ ing a forest in search of a particular quar@@ ry , who fin@@ ds other qu@@ arri@@ es along the way .
now the students and i enjo@@ yed the class , but it occur@@ red to me that while the subject matter of the class is advanced and modern , the teaching technology isn &apos;t .
and i like that kind of response .
they got this statement of ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment .
and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pur@@ sue space explor@@ ation as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , i always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit mo@@ ons and spac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft .
you can see , there &apos;s satur@@ n , there &apos;s ju@@ pit@@ er , and while we &apos;re here , i want to point out something .
it looks like i &apos;ve pau@@ sed the program .
you know , the theme today is &quot; the world in your gras@@ p . &quot;
they said , &quot; you know what ? indi@@ ans don &apos;t do innovation . &quot; the more pol@@ ite ones said , &quot; well , you know , indi@@ ans make good software programm@@ ers and accoun@@ tan@@ ts , but they can &apos;t do the creative stuff . &quot; sometimes , it took a more , took a ven@@ eer of sophistic@@ ation , and people said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s nothing to do with indi@@ ans . it &apos;s really the ru@@ le-@@ based , regi@@ mented education system in india that is responsible for killing all creativity . &quot; they said , instead , if you want to see real creativity ,
interest@@ ingly , what he fin@@ ds is — and by the way , the way we look at the quality of a patent is what we call forward cit@@ ations : how many times
which was considered dead for a long time in the west .
that &apos;s where the important market leadership is .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : pro@@ mp@@ ted by the en@@ cycl@@ op@@ a@@ e@@ dia brit@@ an@@ ni@@ ca ending its print public@@ ation , performance po@@ et ri@@ ves re@@ sur@@ rec@@ ts a game from his childhood . speaking at the tedx@@ su@@ mm@@ it in do@@ ha , ri@@ ves takes us on a char@@ ming tour through random bits of human knowledge : from ch@@ im@@ bor@@ a@@ zo , the far@@ the@@ st point from the center of the earth , to ham the astro@@ ch@@ im@@ p , the first chimpan@@ zee in ou@@ ter space .
that took me to this wet and warm band of the tro@@ pic@@ s that en@@ circ@@ les the earth .

so , we worked on ar@@ du@@ ino and a lot of other projects there to create plat@@ forms that would be simple for our students to use ,
wr@@ aps everything together into a ma@@ shu@@ p of open-source technologies
and you assemb@@ le it into a project .
actually they just build them themselves for a lot less using ar@@ du@@ ino and a few parts .
the last project i want to show you is this :
why is this happening ?
now , you know the idea of a bur@@ ning platform , that you &apos;re somewhere where the costs of sta@@ ying where you are become greater than the costs of moving to something different , perhaps something radic@@ ally different .
he vie@@ wed talent differently .
so this is good . it &apos;s not bad .
and i &apos;m not talking about the mo@@ ther@@ hood sense here .
the train has left the station . the cat is out of the bag .
the internet gives us access , not just to information and knowledge , but to the intelligence con@@ ta@@ ined in the c@@ ran@@ ia of other people on a global basis .
this is a huge collaboration .
in fact , i &apos;ve managed to stay clear of hospitals for almost three decades , perhaps my prou@@ dest ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment .
&apos;@@ i &apos;m being pu@@ shed into a gra@@ ve . the situation is gra@@ ve , &apos; i mo@@ an .
and if the words get ju@@ mb@@ led up enough , it &apos;s called &quot; word sal@@ ad . &quot;
&apos;@@ are you on drugs ? &apos; one asked . &apos; are you high ? &apos;
this inci@@ dent resul@@ ted in my in@@ volun@@ t@@ ary hosp@@ itali@@ zation .
for years , i had resi@@ sted medic@@ ation , making many , many effor@@ ts to get off .
you &apos;re off@@ ering to put me in hospitals ?
so let me share some final thoughts .

now , the combination of both effects -- the ex@@ pul@@ sion of magne@@ tic fields and zero electrical resistance -- is exactly a super@@ conduc@@ tor .

technology has made our world increasingly open , and for the most part , that &apos;s great , but all of this open@@ ness may have un@@ inten@@ ded consequences .
where the terrori@@ st war room goo@@ g@@ led him , and found a picture and called their oper@@ atives on the ground and said , &quot; your ho@@ stage , is he hea@@ v@@ y@@ set ?
in the old days , it was a kni@@ fe and a gun .
the uk i know has some very stri@@ ct fire@@ arms laws .
and you can take those yea@@ st and make them make the coca@@ ine for you ,
how will we protect them in the future ?
whether or not you realize it , we are at the da@@ wn of a technological arms race , an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill .
i &apos;d like to talk about my dad .
if the mon@@ ster wants you , the mon@@ ster &apos;s gon@@ na get you .
you get muscle tre@@ mor@@ s , and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile .
in the ocean , what is the common point between oil , plastic and radio@@ activity ?
and so , i thought , what about if we just take the ru@@ dder from the back of the boat to the front , would we have better control ?
after this , we wanted to see if we could imple@@ ment this and autom@@ ate the system ,
so we may have developed the technology which is very efficient for pul@@ ling something long and heavy ,
they made it , but they eventually published a simp@@ li@@ fied design .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1@@ 500 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and if it goes horri@@ bly wrong , no wor@@ ries .
this idea is so per@@ va@@ sive -- that games are a waste of time that we will come to re@@ gr@@ et -- that i hear it literally everywhere i go .
a recent study from the university of mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an showed that these games are incredibly powerful relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ management tools .
it happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
and soon , i started hearing from people all over the world who were adop@@ ting their own secret identity , rec@@ ru@@ iting their own al@@ lies , and they were getting &quot; super better , &quot; facing challenges like cancer and chron@@ ic pain , depression and cro@@ h@@ n &apos;s disease .
i wanted to understand the phenomenon better , so i de@@ vou@@ red the scientific liter@@ ature , and here &apos;s what i learned .
so tac@@ k@@ ling a tiny challenge without giving up , even one as ab@@ sur@@ d as sn@@ apping your fing@@ ers exactly 50 times or coun@@ ting back@@ wards from 100 by seven is actually a scienti@@ fic@@ ally v@@ ali@@ d@@ ated way to bo@@ ost your wil@@ l@@ power .
it turns out that people who reg@@ ularly bo@@ ost these four types of resi@@ li@@ ence -- physical , mental , emotional and social -- live 10 years longer than everyone else .

there &apos;s a project going on at u@@ c da@@ vis where people are using pro@@ bio@@ tics to try and treat , prevent , nec@@ ro@@ ti@@ zing enter@@ o@@ col@@ it@@ is in pre@@ mat@@ ure inf@@ ants .
and i was getting up every five minutes to pe@@ e , and drin@@ king everybody &apos;s water at the table ,
so , let &apos;s fire it up and see what it does .
the son@@ gs are a little similar , but mostly i &apos;m just interested in the idea that some@@ day maybe we &apos;ll buy a song because we like the way it looks .
and with some cu@@ st@@ om software and a kin@@ ect , i can walk right into the lec@@ ture .
actually , it &apos;s all just an idea .
first , we believe that before people turn over control to an autonom@@ ous car , that autonom@@ ous car should be at least as good as the very best human dri@@ vers .
it really makes you think ,
so watch as john does this here .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 1@@ 50@@ 7 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
i could build for you a structure up here in 3d , milli@@ meter accurate , that only you could see , or my friends at home .
every time her ex@@ -@@ bo@@ y@@ friend would show up , at the most im@@ prob@@ able times and the most im@@ prob@@ able loc@@ ations , he was carrying an open laptop ,
chinese manufac@@ tur@@ ers now sell thousands of nearly iden@@ tical devices on the internet .
but if you send in a fa@@ ke gps signal , another pe@@ ak pop@@ s up , and if you can get these two pe@@ a@@ ks perfectly ali@@ g@@ ned , the tracking points can &apos;t tell the difference ,
so something felt very wrong about the world .
&lt; / doc &gt;
you , like the people that are tr@@ apped in my work
so , the guy is telling the cat , don &apos;t you d@@ are think outside the box .
so for various reasons , we took this on@@ co@@ gene , atta@@ ched it to a blue mar@@ ker , and we injec@@ ted it into the embr@@ y@@ os .
we found some goo@@ ey material that had the right extr@@ ac@@ el@@ lu@@ lar matri@@ x in it , we put the cells in it , and lo and beh@@ old , in about four days , they got re@@ organized
we in@@ ject them into the mouse , the ones on the right , and none of them would make tumor@@ s .
you put the cancer cells there , and they do go all over ,
but we know nothing , but nothing , about the language and al@@ pha@@ bet of form .
and combin@@ ed , this is going to result in two million fewer children dying every year , last year , than in the year 2000 .
and , i &apos;d argue , the security and future of you and your family is also at sta@@ ke .
with population incre@@ ases , consumption patterns increasing , and conflict over scar@@ ce natural resources .
j@@ d : it does , and we &apos;re having a huge debate in this country about aid levels , for example , and aid alone is not the whole solution . nobody thinks it is .
so i &apos;ve never seen color ,
because color is almost everywhere ,
i started having this secon@@ d@@ ary effect
because ultra@@ viol@@ et is a dangerous color ,

that &apos;s just under the gdp of great britain .
we will need the applic@@ ation of military force .
but by a combination of human@@ itarian organizations : oper@@ ation hope , project smile .
no . this is a graphic of the world according to twitter .
i would close by saying that we heard earlier today about wikipedia . i use wikipedia all the time to look up facts , and as all of you appreci@@ ate , wikipedia is not created by 12 brilliant people loc@@ ked in a room writing artic@@ les .
a simp@@ li@@ stic answer would be , the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves leg@@ ally .

it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to conver@@ t that image that we just took into a sort of digital fing@@ er@@ print ,
and it &apos;s pretty incredible because i took my iphone there , and he was like , &quot; yeah , do you want an up@@ grade ? &quot;
so , we kind of to@@ yed around with this idea , and we said , &quot; what can we do with this ?
out comes this , a little lunch box -- form factor .
in the sense that it really dis@@ su@@ ades people from getting access to health care .

and i &apos;m going to take you through the architecture of the machine — that &apos;s why it &apos;s computer architecture — and tell you about this machine , which is a computer .
which was wea@@ ving these incredible patterns controlled by pun@@ ch cards ,
because of course , there &apos;s never been a mathema@@ tici@@ an that &apos;s gone crazy ,
it doesn &apos;t matter if your computer &apos;s mechan@@ ical , like bab@@ bage &apos;s was , or electron@@ ic , like computers are today ,
because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you &apos;ve got to look at this hu@@ mon@@ g@@ ous thing and say , &quot; ah , i see the memory operating , i see the c@@ p@@ u operating ,
i pro@@ pose we look to nature .
we can change the fol@@ ding ra@@ ti@@ o again to produce this shape , or this shape .
and that we can use to control the fol@@ ding .
in this case , the process is deter@@ mini@@ stic .

george dra@@ ined another glass of c@@ lar@@ et and turned to me .
we don &apos;t even find dead bodies .
looking at this picture on the left of new york city today ,
so the problems of bees today isn &apos;t necessarily
so we need bees and they &apos;re dis@@ appe@@ aring and it &apos;s a big problem .
we also have a classroom hi@@ ves project ,
the bee dies . hon@@ e@@ y@@ bees die when they sting , so they don &apos;t want to do it either . it &apos;s nothing to pan@@ ic about . they &apos;re all over the city .
the four countries have no access to facebook .
you have twitter , we have wei@@ bo .
so when these 300 million people , micro@@ blo@@ g@@ gers , even they block the twe@@ et in our cen@@ sor@@ ed platform . but itself -- the ch@@ in@@ an@@ et -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the chinese history .
so because of this , the chinese really reg@@ ard this micro@@ blo@@ gging as a media , not only a head@@ line to media .
so this wei@@ bo social media , even in the cen@@ sor@@ ship , still gave the chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day ch@@ at@@ ting together , talking together .
you know , the ser@@ ver is in the &#91; central &#93; cat@@ s &apos; hands ,
it &apos;s very simple , because chinese central government doesn &apos;t need to even lead the public opini@@ on .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 15@@ 24 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;

so he t@@ wi@@ sted his memory around .
and i found that that was a very interesting thing to explore and use , and it caused me to create the next effect that i &apos;ll show you , which is
so what you &apos;re actually seeing now is the train is not moving at all , and what is actually moving is the floor .
and he said , &quot; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &quot;
it &apos;s this familiar instrument , it &apos;s ti@@ m@@ br@@ al range is actually

and this is what it looks like in my classroom .
and we actually moved into the ha@@ mp@@ tons , pa@@ yed 3@@ ,@@ 500 dollars a week for a house , and we learned how to sur@@ f .
and when we realized that we were growing for food justice in the south bron@@ x , so did the international community .
and that to me , people , is another true &quot; s@@ í se pu@@ e@@ de &quot; moment .
creating far@@ ms in the middle of for@@ d@@ ham road for awareness
i grow seven kinds of min@@ t in my class .
so , my good friend ker@@ mit said it &apos;s not easy being green .
in some parts of the world , for example , south africa , education is just not rea@@ di@@ ly ac@@ ces@@ sible .
so to put that number in perspective , for andrew to reach that same size audience by teaching a stanford class , he would have to do that for 250 years .
or r@@ yan , who can &apos;t go to school , because his immun@@ e de@@ fic@@ i@@ ent daughter can &apos;t be ris@@ ked to have ger@@ ms come into the house , so he couldn &apos;t leave the house .
this one that appeared in science last year , for example , demonstr@@ ates that even simple re@@ tri@@ e@@ val practice , where students are just supposed to repe@@ at what they already learned gives consi@@ der@@ ably impro@@ ved results on various achie@@ vement tests down the line than many other educ@@ ational interven@@ tions .
now , of course we cannot yet grade the range of work that one needs for all cour@@ ses .
the first is that it has the potential of giving us a completely un@@ prece@@ den@@ ted look into understanding human learning .
imagine if we could teach so that 9@@ 8 percent of our students would be above average .
and if we could offer that person an education , they would be able to come up with the next big idea and make the world a better place for all of us .
did they eat fish and chips ?

and the answer would appear to be yes , and the language would appear to be food .
so we invented , without asking , of course , the incredible edi@@ ble green route .

now that expen@@ se can be huge , but if the town can mobi@@ li@@ ze x amount of volunte@@ ers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s contribu@@ tion .

chinese workers are not forced into fac@@ t@@ ories because of our in@@ sati@@ able desire for i@@ po@@ ds .
just because a person sp@@ ends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
she pau@@ sed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6@@ ,000 y@@ u@@ an or 6@@ ,000 american dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6@@ ,000 . &quot; min &apos;s sister &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friend , who had travel@@ ed home with her for the new year , said , &quot; it doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s worth that much . &quot;
and it is glob@@ alization , this chain that begins in a chinese far@@ ming village and ends with i@@ phones in our po@@ ckets and ni@@ kes on our feet and co@@ ach hand@@ ba@@ gs on our arms
i mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that &apos;s not why they &apos;re in the city , and that &apos;s not what they care about .

there is no &quot; find terrori@@ st &quot; bu@@ tton , and the more data we integr@@ ate from a vast variety of sources across a wide variety of data for@@ mat@@ s from very disp@@ ar@@ ate systems , the less effective data min@@ ing can be .
these were networks of mer@@ cen@@ aries , not ide@@ olo@@ gues , who were in the c@@ oor@@ din@@ ation business for profit .
from the same educ@@ ational background , similar occu@@ p@@ ation ,
in the sorts of countries i work in , that so-@@ called treatment gap approach@@ es an aston@@ ishing 90 percent .
well today , i &apos;m very ple@@ ased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shif@@ ting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you
indeed , to imple@@ ment the slo@@ gan of health for all , we will need to invol@@ ve all in that particular journey ,
now one of the things that we know is that companies are very good at getting people to work together in teams and in networks to make very complex products , like cars and computers ,
sure , we invest pl@@ enty in innovation . we invest in broad@@ band and science education and science gr@@ ants , but we invest far too little in re@@ inven@@ ting and re@@ designing the institutions that we have .
it &apos;s also about creating government .
and we see lots of examples of these innov@@ ators using open government data , not simply to make app@@ s , but then to make companies and to hi@@ re people to build them working with the government .
obviously opening up the data is one , but the important thing is to create lots more -- create and cur@@ ate -- lots more partici@@ pat@@ ory opportunities .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
and particularly in the developing world , it &apos;s where women find opportunities .
and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood .
you just spin and go directly in . so we &apos;ve been working with a company to commerci@@ alize this .
when you give an alternative to a person to re@@ act to .
we don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
the mur@@ der happened a little over 21 years ago , janu@@ ary the 18@@ th , 199@@ 1 , in a small be@@ droom community of ly@@ n@@ wood , california , just a few miles sou@@ the@@ ast of los angeles .
first of all , we have all the statist@@ ical analy@@ ses from the inno@@ c@@ ence project work ,
take all the measu@@ re@@ ments and record them , right ?
so in fact , we found the same iden@@ tical conditions , we re@@ construc@@ ted the entire thing again ,
why did i take the risk ?
we all have to be very car@@ eful .
that is to say , micro@@ al@@ ga@@ e contribu@@ tes between 2,000 and 5,000 gall@@ ons per ac@@ re per year , compared to the 50 gall@@ ons per ac@@ re per year from so@@ y .
so you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; ge@@ e , this sounds like a good idea . what can we do to try to see if it &apos;s real ? &quot;
harve@@ st that by a proce@@ dure where you flo@@ at the al@@ ga@@ e
we &apos;d be growing o@@ y@@ sters and things that would be producing high value products and food ,
sustainable solutions for our future problems are going to be diverse and are going to be many .
because right now there are some really extraordinary things that we are doing with stem cells
this was really an extraordinary advan@@ ce , because although these cells are not human embr@@ y@@ onic stem cells , which still remain the gold standard , they are terri@@ fic to use for model@@ ing disease and potentially for drug discovery .
and you &apos;re going to know at the beginning , the very early sta@@ ges of doing your as@@ say development
so that is terri@@ fic ,
thank you .
it &apos;s also involved in social interaction , understanding other people , and self-@@ awareness .
with his arms , and pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly has a similar
you &apos;ll see that this is exactly the same condition , only in the no@@ -@@ director condition they just have to remember to apply this some@@ what ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary rule , whereas
they take more risks than children or adults , and they are particularly pr@@ one to taking risks when they &apos;re with their friends . there &apos;s an important drive to become independent from one &apos;s parents and to im@@ press one &apos;s friends in adole@@ sc@@ ence .
it &apos;s time to start designing for our e@@ ars .
this is an area i inten@@ d to take on this year .
if you take that 1.@@ 2 seconds down to 0@@ .@@ 4 seconds

because they like noise and they need qui@@ et .
this was great . my pig@@ s turned that food waste into del@@ ici@@ ous por@@ k . i sold that por@@ k to my school friends &apos; parents , and i made a good po@@ cket money addition to my teen@@ age allo@@ wan@@ ce .
so i decided to un@@ pack that data a little bit further to see if that was true or fal@@ se .
this is what most of us think of when we think of food waste , what ends up in the gar@@ bage , what ends up in super@@ market bin@@ s , what ends up in restaurant bin@@ s . we &apos;ve lost another two ,
li@@ ver , lun@@ gs , heads , ta@@ ils , kid@@ ne@@ ys , te@@ stic@@ les , all of these things which are traditional , del@@ ici@@ ous and nutri@@ tious parts of our ga@@ stron@@ om@@ y go to waste . off@@ al consumption has hal@@ ved in britain and america in the last 30 years .

and i get into the trau@@ ma room ,
i dro@@ ve a motor@@ cycle , i was un@@ married , i ow@@ ned a bar , so those were different times . but i had three days of life support , and everybody was expe@@ cting , due to just the massive amount of what they had had to do that i wasn &apos;t going to make it ,

if you use them poor@@ ly , bad idea . right ?
really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occu@@ p@@ y space .
so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
this one has been du@@ b@@ bed the &quot; wonder woman &quot; by the media .
for some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting .
we also evalu@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively over@@ all . &quot;
and i convinced someone , my an@@ gel ad@@ vis@@ or , su@@ san fis@@ ke , to take me on , and so i ended up at prin@@ ce@@ ton ,
and so i want to say to you , don &apos;t fa@@ ke it ti@@ ll you make it .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : shi@@ mon sch@@ oc@@ ken and no@@ am ni@@ san developed a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um for their students to build a computer , piece by piece . when they put the course online -- giving away the tools , simul@@ ators , chip specific@@ ations and other building blocks -- they were surprised that thousands jump@@ ed at the opportunity to learn , working indepen@@ den@@ tly as well as organi@@ zing their own cla@@ sses in the first massive open online course . a call to forget about gra@@ des and ta@@ p into the self-@@ motiv@@ ation to learn .
so i &apos;d like to share with you a story about a self-@@ study , self-@@ em@@ power@@ ing computer science course that i built , together with my brilliant collea@@ gue no@@ am ni@@ san .
and para@@ g sha@@ h , another engineer , from mu@@ m@@ ba@@ i , has un@@ bun@@ d@@ led our projects into smaller , more mana@@ ge@@ able bit@@ es that he now ser@@ ves in his pion@@ eer@@ ing do@@ -@@ it@@ -@@ yourself computer science program .
and share with you a gli@@ mp@@ se from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same character@@ ist@@ ics of self-@@ learning , learning by doing , self-@@ explor@@ ation and comm@@ un@@ it@@ y-@@ building ,
and because we cannot do it on our own , we &apos;ve developed a very fan@@ cy auth@@ or@@ ing tool that any auth@@ or , any par@@ ent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education , can use this auth@@ or@@ ing tool to develop similar app@@ s on tab@@ lets without programm@@ ing .

and it was really at the time i was wondering why doesn &apos;t the computer respond to sound ?
and i often say , well , there &apos;s something good to how things
it &apos;s a hier@@ arch@@ y . we all know that a hier@@ arch@@ y is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it &apos;s been dis@@ rup@@ ted .
and one thing i &apos;ve been doing is doing some research on systems that can comb@@ ine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective .
&lt; speaker &gt; ra@@ ch@@ el bo@@ ts@@ man &lt; / speaker &gt;

meet 4@@ 6@@ -year-old chris mo@@ k , who has , i bet ,
in a similar way that companies often use some kind of credit r@@ ating to decide whether to give you a mobile plan , or the rate of a mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge , marke@@ t@@ places that dep@@ end on trans@@ actions between rel@@ ative str@@ ang@@ ers need some kind of device to let you know that sebastian and chris are good eg@@ gs ,
those guys are meas@@ uring influence , not behaviors that indic@@ ate our tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
now , st@@ ack over@@ flow is basically a platform where experienced programm@@ ers can ask other good programm@@ ers highly deta@@ iled technical questions on things like tiny pi@@ x@@ els and chro@@ me exten@@ sions .

i was doing it , every time i did a point that they didn &apos;t like , they actually thre@@ w st@@ ones at me ,
thank you .
the problem with questions is they create un@@ certain@@ ty .
the first step was to ask a question .
what was really exciting about this project was we , and be@@ au , had no idea whether it would work .
the first auth@@ or is blac@@ ka@@ w@@ ton primary school , because
shi@@ mon sch@@ oc@@ ken : right , but i like myself .
well , he asked me if i could find some technological way to un@@ fold a fi@@ ve-@@ centu@@ ri@@ es@@ -@@ old myster@@ y related to a lost ma@@ ster@@ piece by leon@@ ardo da vin@@ ci , the &quot; battle of ang@@ hi@@ ari , &quot; which is supposed to be loc@@ ated in the hall of the 500 in pal@@ a@@ z@@ zo ve@@ c@@ chi@@ o , in fl@@ or@@ ence .
and with a 4@@ mm camera atta@@ ched to it , we were successful in documen@@ ting and taking some frag@@ ments of what it turns out to be a red@@ dish color , black color , and there is some be@@ ige frag@@ ments that later on
and we just a@@ im the camera of the tab@@ let to the painting that we are interested to see , like this .

or as the ball@@ et dan@@ cer al@@ on@@ zo king said , &quot; what &apos;s interesting about you is you . &quot;
and i &apos;ve looked at the cros@@ s-@@ bor@@ der component as a percentage of the total .
let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business revie@@ w was kind enough to run of its rea@@ dership as to what people &apos;s gu@@ ess@@ es along these dimensions actually were .
and then the final reason , which i mention , especially to a ted audience , with some tre@@ p@@ id@@ ation , has to do with what i call &quot; techno@@ -@@ tran@@ ces . &quot;
or to take an even more stri@@ king example , when the chicago coun@@ cil on foreign rel@@ ations did a survey of americans , asking them to guess what percentage of the feder@@ al budget went to foreign aid , the guess was 30 percent , which is slightly in ex@@ cess of the actual level — — of u.s. govern@@ mental commit@@ ments to feder@@ al aid .
the children looked and were ama@@ zed .
and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
all of them except one . can you guess which one ?
but again , when it comes to the decisions which are imp@@ acting us the most , perhaps , the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth ,
sharing accoun@@ t@@ ability . also , the fact that he thre@@ aten@@ ed to sue me because i got a lea@@ k of his lea@@ ks , i thought that showed a remarkable sort of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cy in ide@@ ology , to be honest , as well . the other thing is that power is incredibly se@@ duc@@ tive , and you must have two real qu@@ alities , i think , when you come to the table , when you &apos;re dealing with power , talking about power , because of its se@@ duc@@ tive capacity .
well , to go back to our original story , the parents have pan@@ ic@@ ked . they &apos;ve loc@@ ked all the doors .
but how can i tell an ei@@ ght-@@ year-old boy that his father is a politi@@ ci@@ an ? &quot; now , as a politi@@ ci@@ an myself , standing in front of you , or indeed , meeting any stran@@ ger anywhere in the world , when i eventually reve@@ al the nature of my profes@@ sion , they look at me as though i &apos;m somewhere between a sna@@ ke , a mon@@ key and an i@@ gu@@ ana ,
i remember in iraq , for example , that we went through a period of feeling that we should del@@ ay democracy .

these all have similar effects on jud@@ gment .

one of the most unique things that bat@@ s do as a mamm@@ al is that they fly .

so bat@@ s are also important for our health , to en@@ able us to better understand how our genome func@@ tions .

we were sort of very gun@@ g h@@ o with our success in australia and new ze@@ al@@ and at that stage .

it &apos;s that we expect them to bring us
what i &apos;d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we &apos;ve been investig@@ ating , and that &apos;s min@@ d-@@ w@@ ander@@ ing .
no@@ pe . as it turns out , people are less happy when they &apos;re min@@ d-@@ w@@ ander@@ ing no matter what they &apos;re doing . for example ,
in my talk today , i &apos;ve told you a little bit about min@@ d-@@ w@@ ander@@ ing , a vari@@ able that i think turns out to be fairly important in the equ@@ ation for happiness .

richard ford : i was slow to learn to read , went all the way
j@@ b : richard ser@@ ra says that so non@@ ch@@ al@@ antly , you might have mis@@ sed it . he went and saw this painting by a guy who &apos;d been dead for 300 years , and realized , &quot; i can &apos;t do that , &quot; and so richard ser@@ ra went back to his studio in fl@@ or@@ ence , picked up all of his work up to that point , and thre@@ w it in a river .
probably from the b@@ low , because it was an in@@ s@@ ult in a way .
you have to take a picture .
then , being her husband , i ran behind her

in this machine , any rural woman can apply the same ra@@ w materials that they are processing in the mul@@ tin@@ ational plant , anyone can make a worl@@ d-@@ class n@@ ap@@ k@@ in at your din@@ ing hall .

and the majority of these people live in rural areas , where the only connections to community , to emplo@@ y@@ ment , to education , are by traveling long di@@ stances on rou@@ gh ter@@ rain often under their own power .

these are the people that define the requi@@ re@@ ments of the technology , and these are the people that have to give the thu@@ mb@@ s-@@ up at the end , and say , &quot; yeah , it actually works . it mee@@ ts our needs . &quot;

there &apos;s not one week that goes without some major head@@ lines in the media about whether video games are good or bad for you , right ? you &apos;re all bom@@ bar@@ ded with that .
&#91; &quot; horse &quot; &#93; d@@ b : yellow . audience : yellow .
the other one is the front@@ al lo@@ be , which contro@@ ls how we susta@@ in attention , and another one is the an@@ ter@@ ior c@@ ing@@ ul@@ ate , which contro@@ ls how we al@@ loc@@ ate and regul@@ ate attention and re@@ solve conflict .
now because we are interested in having an impact for education or re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation of patients , we are actually not that interested in how those of you that choose to play video games for many hours on end perform .
there is an entertainment software industry which is extremely de@@ ft at coming up with appe@@ aling products that you can &apos;t resi@@ st .
we call ourselves the sleep@@ y man ban@@ jo boys .
&quot; oh , but sur@@ ely someone must be in charge .
so after a while they would all come back because they have sort of gotten used to char@@ ges .
and the other question , who changed their mind ? who changed their opini@@ on , and why ?
life was good .
&quot; come on . this is our opportunity . &quot;
and if you walk again , it will be with cali@@ pers and a walking frame . &quot;
and even lying par@@ aly@@ zed in the spin@@ al ward , there were moments of incredible dep@@ th and rich@@ ness , of auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity and connection that i had never experienced before .
gone . &quot;
and that reali@@ zation was about to change my life .

and then i learned to fly in bad weather as well as fine weather

not just here in the west .
but the good news is that the global ji@@ had is almost over , as bin laden defined it .
it &apos;s old school al q@@ a@@ eda .
who killed bin la@@ den@@ ism ? ab@@ u mu@@ sa@@ b al-@@ z@@ ar@@ q@@ aw@@ i killed it .
we &apos;ve got pl@@ enty of these things .
it &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
look , i lied to the fe@@ ds . i lost a year of my life from it .
and i &apos;m spor@@ t@@ in &apos; tor@@ n jor@@ dans .
very next day , i b@@ op@@ ped into school with my brand new air jor@@ dans , man , i was cool .
and from then on , i started ch@@ as@@ ing eth@@ eri@@ dge k@@ night .

one of the key technologies that &apos;s really important is what &apos;s called in@@ duc@@ ed plu@@ ri@@ po@@ tent stem cells .
don &apos;t you miss all that with these tis@@ su@@ e-@@ engineer@@ ed models ?
that was common practice in the industry , and those who held pat@@ ents on air@@ planes were defen@@ ding them fi@@ er@@ cel@@ y
thir@@ ty-@@ four million are infected with hiv .
in 2010 , un@@ ita@@ id establi@@ shed the medic@@ ines patent pool for hiv .
nelson &apos;s expect@@ ations are very high , and quite ri@@ ghtly so . he and his son will need access to the next generation of anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ als and the next , throughout their lifetime , so that he and many others in kenya and other countries can continue to live healthy , active lives .
they are grown completely in a ball of dun@@ g .
and the quic@@ ke@@ st way to do it is in a straight line .
and it was this particular little behavior , the dance , that we thought was important , because look , it takes a pau@@ se every now and then , and then heads off in the direction that it wants to go in .
it isn &apos;t cli@@ mb@@ ing . it isn &apos;t dan@@ cing , because its body temperature is actually relatively low .
and it &apos;s actually taking a pel@@ let of dry dun@@ g with it .
if he &apos;s using path inte@@ gra@@ tion , then it should end up in the wrong spot over here .
i love coming to do@@ ha . it &apos;s such an international place .
no , there &apos;s serious issues in the region .
and like i said , you guys are doing a lot cultur@@ ally ,
that way no one knows what you &apos;re saying . life goes on .
so i wrote a letter .
and that goes for every single person in this room .
took the twitter conversation in ta@@ h@@ ri@@ r square on the day that h@@ os@@ n@@ i mu@@ bar@@ ak would eventually re@@ sign ,
and when we went through all those various cities , we found that in florida , there were th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms and rain on the day .
we looked at the cur@@ bs . the cur@@ bs were thro@@ wing sha@@ dows south , so we could tell the bridge was running ea@@ st-@@ west across the river .
given a couple of clu@@ es , i could probably find out a lot of things about most of you in the audience that you might not like me finding out .
george lee m@@ all@@ ory . many of you will know his name .
the journey from a small weather station on the north coast of si@@ beri@@ a up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fe@@ ar@@ less fel@@ i@@ x b@@ au@@ m@@ gar@@ t@@ ner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate the sense of app@@ re@@ hen@@ sion , as i sat in a hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter th@@ under@@ ing north , and the sense , i think if anything , of im@@ pen@@ ding d@@ oom .
i can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to bur@@ n up all the money i can get my hands on , to ru@@ in every relationship i &apos;ve ever had , so be car@@ eful what you wish for .
i &apos;m well aware of the iron@@ y of telling you that we will be blo@@ gging and twee@@ ting . you &apos;ll be able to live vic@@ ari@@ ously and vir@@ tually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
instead of inve@@ sting in a car , we invest in a community .
and it &apos;s not just with transpor@@ tation , my love , but of course in other real@@ ms . here &apos;s fi@@ ver@@ r@@ .com .
hours and hours of sitting with insur@@ ers and many companies and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innov@@ ative , they &apos;d never thought of it before .
a driver was telling me that they went to r@@ ent a car to go up the coast of france and the ow@@ ner gave it to them , and said , &quot; you know what , here &apos;s where the cli@@ ff@@ s are , and here &apos;s all the be@@ ach@@ es , and this is my best beach , and this is where the best fish restaurant is . &quot;
i &apos;m here to tell you the secret to successful deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making : a che@@ ese sand@@ w@@ ich .
here &apos;s one example : neur@@ o drin@@ ks , a line of products , including nu@@ er@@ o bli@@ ss here ,
it quickly became the most e@@ ma@@ iled article on the site .
these sc@@ ans , the clin@@ ics say , can help prevent alzheimer &apos;s disease , solve weight and addic@@ tion issues , over@@ come mar@@ ital conflic@@ ts , and treat , of course , a variety of mental ill@@ ne@@ sses ran@@ ging from depression to an@@ x@@ iety to ad@@ h@@ d .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : when war between israel and iran seemed im@@ min@@ ent , isra@@ el@@ i graphic designer ron@@ ny e@@ dry shared a poster on facebook of himself and his daughter with a b@@ old message : &quot; ir@@ ani@@ ans ... we &#91; heart &#93; you . &quot; other isra@@ el@@ is quickly created their own po@@ sters with the same message -- and ir@@ ani@@ ans respon@@ ded in kind . the simple act of communication inspired surprising facebook communities like &quot; israel lo@@ ves iran , &quot; &quot; iran lo@@ ves israel &quot; and even &quot; palest@@ ine lo@@ ves israel . &quot;
so i start answer@@ ing this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come ,
they have graphic designers . what ? crazy , crazy .
today the isra@@ el@@ -@@ lo@@ ve@@ s-@@ iran page is this number , 8@@ 0@@ ,@@ 8@@ 31 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , i don &apos;t know , com@@ mented on one of the photos .
at some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
just raise that . exactly .
they just f@@ ought off a king . they &apos;re not going to accept some central authority . &quot;
especially if we raise tax@@ es on the rich .
but here &apos;s what i learned .
that is democratic and re@@ publi@@ can issues ,
you were a free market cap@@ itali@@ st econom@@ ist or you were a key@@ ne@@ si@@ an liber@@ al econom@@ ist ,
then you can see radical par@@ tis@@ an change .
the fear is that the world is watching .
gi@@ am@@ bat@@ ti@@ sta del@@ la port@@ a , a ne@@ apol@@ it@@ an schol@@ ar in the 16@@ th century , exam@@ ined and studied the natural world and saw how it could be manipul@@ ated .
now , when you talk about dangerous animals , most people might think of lions or ti@@ gers or sharks .
and that &apos;s the ni@@ ck@@ name given to this disease . it &apos;s called break@@ bone fe@@ ver , because that &apos;s how you can feel .
interest@@ ingly , ma@@ de@@ ir@@ a first got the in@@ sect in 2005 , and here we are , a few years later , first cases of den@@ gue .
we want something that &apos;s relatively cheap , or co@@ st-@@ effective , because there &apos;s an awful lot of countries involved ,
if they don &apos;t find a female , then they &apos;ll die anyway .
and when you think about genetic engineering , we &apos;ve now got enz@@ y@@ mes for industrial processing , enz@@ y@@ mes , gene@@ tically engineer@@ ed enz@@ y@@ mes in food .
han@@ sen says we can expect about a fi@@ ve-@@ meter rise in sea levels .
let me translat@@ e for you .
we love to circle around things .
it &apos;s so that the bloo@@ ds and the cri@@ ps will know which side to vote for . the pol@@ ari@@ zation is stron@@ gest among our political el@@ ites .
these changes are deta@@ iled in many books .
should we be surprised when the whole thing free@@ zes up and de@@ sc@@ ends into par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and pol@@ ari@@ zation ?
but it &apos;s not just money . it &apos;s also st@@ ability versus chaos .
so to conclu@@ de , there are at least four astero@@ ids head@@ ed our way .
let us therefore go to battle stations ,
a part of me had become ali@@ en@@ ated from myself .
now you have this concept in your mind . you &apos;re all part of the art@@ work too .
but they loved the hell out of me . they loved me so much .
my favorite page is the &quot; about the auth@@ or &quot; page .
i was really into bell bi@@ v de@@ vo@@ e and m@@ c ha@@ mmer and van@@ illa ice at the time . and to this day , i still can do kara@@ o@@ ke to &quot; ice , ice baby &quot; without looking at the screen . don &apos;t tempt me , because i will do it .
and i loved that thought , of being able to share my ideas through the prin@@ ted page .
now when i was a teen@@ a@@ ger , i was ang@@ sty as any teen@@ a@@ ger was , but after 17 years of having a mother who was in and out of my life like a y@@ o-@@ yo and a father who was fac@@ eless , i was an@@ gry .
now , i used to work the wee@@ ken@@ ds at the hole in the wall off@@ -@@ seas@@ on programm@@ ing to make some extra money as i was trying to get my feet off the ground ,
i have 10 picture books out .

on the contr@@ ary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools ,
for example , it is counter@@ intui@@ tive to have an il@@ liter@@ ate study particip@@ ant , like cel@@ ine , let alone understand .
why the clinical trial should be conduc@@ ted in the first place . now , fortunately for cel@@ ine ,
and they are not mag@@ n@@ anim@@ ous in vic@@ tory .
and that really preven@@ ted the ri@@ ckets that used to be common in this city .
it &apos;s not the heart . what do you do ?
not by much , as an individual level , but enough at a population level to shift the rates of heart disease in a whole population .
so here , further data that ultra@@ viol@@ et -- that &apos;s sun@@ light -- has benefits on the blood flow and the car@@ di@@ o@@ vas@@ cu@@ lar system .
my day job is saying to people , &quot; you &apos;ve got skin cancer , it &apos;s caused by sun@@ light , don &apos;t go in the sun . &quot;
nobody wants an oper@@ ation . in particular , nobody wants an oper@@ ation with tools like these through large inci@@ sions that cause a lot of pain , that cause a lot of time out of work or out of school , that leave a big sc@@ ar .
and eventually , if you &apos;re lucky , you achieve ma@@ ster@@ y .
it &apos;s the primary harvard medical school teaching fac@@ ility .
so we looked for a universal translator ; i thought there would be one out there .
but that &apos;s the lectures .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 16@@ 5@@ 3 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
kids will sometimes perform mon@@ o@@ drama@@ s -- playing house is indeed a mon@@ o@@ dra@@ ma or a play .
take a look at this sentence : &quot; one morning , as gre@@ g@@ or sam@@ sa was wa@@ king up from an@@ xi@@ ous dreams , he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a mon@@ st@@ rou@@ s vermin@@ ous bu@@ g . &quot;
they talk about these kinds of experiences .
i was trying my best , and my teacher came around and asked me , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
that was du@@ ch@@ amp .
so we start to en@@ vy them .
they only get to think for the first five minutes .
it helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alco@@ hol or drugs .
so what should we do now ?
i &apos;m totally clu@@ eless .
the workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instruc@@ tions .
there is this obse@@ ssion with seri@@ ousness .
we have to convince our audience that what we &apos;re talking about matters .
thank you .
at this level of the labor market , what you need is a marke@@ t@@ place for sp@@ are hours .
imagine that a young woman -- base of the economic py@@ rami@@ d , very little pros@@ pe@@ ct of getting a job -- what economic activity could she theore@@ tically engage in ?
and those fac@@ ili@@ ties -- i &apos;m talking about things like the mechanis@@ ms that prove our identity , the licen@@ sing auth@@ orities that know what each of us is allowed to do leg@@ ally at any given time , the processes by which we re@@ solve disp@@ u@@ tes through offici@@ al chan@@ n@@ els .
think of it as a regul@@ ated public u@@ til@@ ity .
and they might be aware that they would have to fund ve@@ tting and training if they wanted to go into that market .
so i started thinking about what should i get my mom for mother &apos;s day ?
now maybe you won &apos;t be so surprised by this , because a lot of times people feel that young people today can do all sorts of things with technology .
after you &apos;ve created your program , you can click on &quot; share , &quot; and then share your project with other people , so that they can use the project and start working on the project as well .
when you learn to read and write , it op@@ ens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things .
and we see that kids learn it more deeply and learn it better .
it &apos;s scrat@@ ch@@ .@@ mit@@ .@@ ed@@ u ,
most people died around the age of 50 .
water consumption has increased to 4@@ 30 lit@@ ers .
do you worry much ?
or should we use something else ?
well to start to do this , we took a 3d printer and we started to print our be@@ a@@ kers and our test tu@@ bes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side

so if i live to see 80 years of age , i &apos;m going to have a fi@@ ve-@@ hour video that en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ates 50 years of my life .

the re@@ ha@@ bil@@ itation of public spaces re@@ vi@@ ved the feeling of belon@@ ging to a city that people lost .
we re@@ moved 12@@ 3,000 tons of concrete only from the ri@@ ver@@ ban@@ ks .
re@@ inven@@ ting the government by re@@ inven@@ ting politics itself is the answer , and not re@@ inven@@ ting people based on a read@@ y-@@ made for@@ mul@@ a that the developed world often tries in va@@ in to imp@@ ose to people like us .

and was one of the lo@@ west education per@@ form@@ ers .
opportunities are un@@ equ@@ ally distribu@@ ted .
and you can see korea inve@@ sting a lot in attrac@@ ting the best people into the teaching profes@@ sion .
but there are some countries which have seen im@@ pre@@ ssive impro@@ ve@@ ments .
and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an im@@ pre@@ ssive impro@@ vement .
but usually that is lin@@ ked to very strong social disp@@ ari@@ ties .
they provide them with the kind of development they need to develop stronger pe@@ da@@ go@@ gical practic@@ es .
if we can help every child , every teacher , every school , every princip@@ al , every par@@ ent see what impro@@ vement is possible , that only the sky is the lim@@ it to education impro@@ vement , we have la@@ id the found@@ ations for better poli@@ cies and better lives .
i ended up in physics by accident .
this is a surprising and pro@@ min@@ ent gap in the liter@@ ature .
because a found@@ ational gu@@ i@@ del@@ ine in science is : let the data speak . okay . let &apos;s do that .
this ended up giving him control in tel@@ ec@@ om itali@@ a with a lever@@ age of 26 .
yet it &quot; gave us a tan@@ tali@@ zing gli@@ mp@@ se of a bra@@ ve new world of finance . &quot;
and why is the for@@ bi@@ dden so ero@@ tic ?
so now we get to the exist@@ enti@@ al reality of the story , right ?
but then the second group is even more interesting . i am most dra@@ wn to my partner when i see him in the studio , when she is on@@ stage , when he is in his element , when she &apos;s doing something she &apos;s passionate about , when i see him at a party and other people are really dra@@ wn to him , when i see her hold court .
what do you se@@ ek to express there ?
and when i began to listen to the sex@@ less@@ ness of the cou@@ ples that i work with , i sometimes would hear people say , &quot; i want more sex , &quot;
but if on this side there is somebody who says , &quot; i &apos;m worried . i &apos;m an@@ xi@@ ous . i &apos;m de@@ pressed .
they also understand that fore@@ play is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
what i &apos;m here to talk with you about today is an intri@@ gu@@ ing new hypothe@@ sis and some surpri@@ sing@@ ly powerful new fin@@ dings that i &apos;ve been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak
now , that fascin@@ ated me end@@ less@@ ly as a child , but what fascin@@ ates me even more today as an econom@@ ist is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time . so for example , if i &apos;m speaking in english , i have to speak gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tically differently if i &apos;m talking about past rain , &quot; it ra@@ ined yesterday , &quot; current rain , &quot; it is ra@@ ining now , &quot; or future rain , &quot; it will rain tomorrow . &quot;
interest@@ ingly enough , when you start to cr@@ ank the data , these po@@ ckets of fu@@ tur@@ eless language spea@@ kers all around the world turn out to be , by and large , some of the world &apos;s best sa@@ vers .
and what i &apos;m going to do is form statist@@ ical mat@@ ched pa@@ irs between families that are nearly iden@@ tical on every dimen@@ sion that i can measure , and then i &apos;m going to explore whether or not the link between language and sa@@ v@@ ings hol@@ ds even after control@@ ling for all of these levels .
it &apos;s almost impossible not to find a sa@@ v@@ ings behavior for which this strong effect isn &apos;t present .
and the sound of a bra@@ in@@ storm , if you &apos;ve never heard one , is some@@ what like this .
and could act outside , in that outside world , just by control@@ ling an artificial device .
the le@@ gen@@ ds that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the mon@@ key .
so where are we taking all this ?
these people are t@@ all .
and if my mother ever questi@@ oned him , he beat her , abu@@ sed her , and really it was difficult .
there was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us .
don &apos;t you have a husband waiting for you ? &quot;
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning
because there had not been any school for girls .
as a new da@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
those ali@@ en creatures right on earth .
and it turns out that the insects fla@@ p their wings in a very cle@@ ver way , at a very high angle of attack
the hal@@ ter@@ es are actually gy@@ ros@@ cop@@ es .
and then something happened when i started to work on flies .
i would pos@@ it that one fron@@ ti@@ er in neurosci@@ ence is to figure out how the brain of that thing works .
you can let the fly play a little video game by le@@ tting it fly around in a visual disp@@ lay .
so here &apos;s two sort of can@@ on@@ ical neurons from a ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate and an in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ate ,
eight in 10 say the family they have today is as strong or stronger than the family they grew up in .
they turned to a cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge program called ag@@ ile development
they do things in small ch@@ un@@ ks .
he said , &quot; in the work@@ place , adults love it .
so what did we learn ?
an environmental psycholo@@ gist told me , &quot; if you &apos;re sitting in a hard chair on a rig@@ id surface , you &apos;ll be more rig@@ id .
but we &apos;re giving them practice becoming independent , which of course is our ultimate goal .
and we ended up with 10 stat@@ e@@ ments .
i was a teen@@ a@@ ger when i first read &quot; an@@ na kar@@ en@@ ina &quot; and its famous opening sentence , &quot; all happy families are ali@@ ke .
&lt; / doc &gt;
they made another machine to produce those people : the school .
how is presen@@ t-@@ day sch@@ oo@@ ling going to pre@@ p@@ are them
so i said , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s possible . &quot;
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad ,
&quot; and anyway , i am going away . &quot;
so she did that for two more months .
what an achie@@ vement that is .
she goes on over sky@@ pe and she sorts things out .
here &apos;s a so@@ le in action .
so we need to design a future for learning .
she suddenly raised her hand like this , and said to me , &quot; get on with it . &quot;
we can fix this . we &apos;re going to go to green@@ ville with my whole cab@@ in@@ et and we will just make electro@@ lu@@ x an offer they can &apos;t refu@@ se . &quot;
who is ever going to hi@@ re me ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; oh my god -- congress , gri@@ d@@ lock , who knows ? &quot;
it &apos;s op@@ t-@@ in . you might even get texas and south carolina , who didn &apos;t op@@ t into the education race to the top , you might even get them to op@@ t in . why ?
&lt; speaker &gt; am@@ anda pal@@ mer &lt; / speaker &gt;
so after all of our shows , we would sign auto@@ graph@@ s and hu@@ g f@@ ans and hang out and talk to people ,
and she took me a@@ side and she said to me in her broken english , &quot; your music has helped my daughter so much .
and the la@@ bel consi@@ ders this a failure .
they don &apos;t want to ask for things .
so a lot of people are confu@@ sed by the idea of no hard stic@@ ker price .
but fossil fu@@ els , carbon -- coal and gas -- are by no means the only thing that is cau@@ sing climate change .
now we know that deser@@ tific@@ ation is caused by li@@ ve@@ stock , mostly cat@@ tle , she@@ ep and go@@ ats , over@@ gra@@ zing the plants ,
and the auth@@ ors of the position paper on climate change from which i ob@@ ta@@ ined these pictures at@@ tribu@@ te this change to &quot; un@@ known processes . &quot;
and we are bur@@ ning in africa , every single year , more than one billion he@@ ct@@ ares of gra@@ ss@@ lands , and almost nobody is talking about it .
but we biolo@@ gists and ecolo@@ gists had never tac@@ kle@@ d anything as complex as this . so rather than re@@ invent the whe@@ el , i began studying other profes@@ sions to see if anybody had .
and i &apos;ve had to mark the hill because the change is so profound .
i &apos;m just going to ask you one quick question .
and we now have video proof , as those of you that saw the discovery channel docu@@ mentary are no doubt aware .
whereas all previous expedi@@ tions had failed to gar@@ ner a single video gli@@ mp@@ se of the giant , we managed six , and the first tri@@ gger@@ ed wild exc@@ it@@ ement .
there are great discover@@ ies yet to be made down there , fantastic creatures represen@@ ting millions of years of evolution and possibly bio@@ active comp@@ ounds that could benefit us in ways that we can &apos;t even yet imagine .
and that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
when i was a kid , i tra@@ ded in home@@ work as@@ sign@@ ments for friend@@ ship , then gave each friend a late sli@@ p for never showing up on time , and in most cases , not at all .
to this day , i hate por@@ k ch@@ op@@ s .
and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspi@@ ration , he remains a conversation piece between people who can &apos;t understand sometimes being dru@@ g-@@ free has less to do with addic@@ tion and more to do with san@@ ity .
but our lives will only ever always continue to be a bal@@ an@@ cing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty .
i sit on the board of a center for the develop@@ men@@ tally dis@@ ab@@ led ,
business@@ week did a survey , looked at the comp@@ ens@@ ation pac@@ ka@@ ges for mb@@ as 10 years out of business school . and the medi@@ an comp@@ ens@@ ation for a stanford mb@@ a ,
that &apos;s an important fact , because it tells us that in 40 years , the non@@ profit sector has not been able to w@@ re@@ st@@ le any market share
well , like most fan@@ ati@@ cal do@@ g@@ ma in america , these ideas come from old pur@@ it@@ an belie@@ fs .
within nine years , we had multi@@ p@@ lied that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times , into 10@@ 8 million dollars after all expen@@ ses , for aids services .
that &apos;s about 300 billion dollars a year .
yeah . i thought so . not surprised .
but we know much less about the circuit basis of psychiatri@@ c dis@@ orders because of the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming domin@@ ance of this chemical im@@ balance hypothe@@ sis .
well , one of the ways that we can start is to try to come up with some general character@@ ist@@ ics or properties of emo@@ tion@@ -@@ like states
there are re@@ pos@@ it@@ ories where you can just pick up the phone and order hundreds of vi@@ als of flies of different mu@@ tan@@ ts
now what &apos;s the cau@@ s@@ al relationship , if anything , between these phen@@ o@@ types ?
&lt; / doc &gt;
a local newspaper spel@@ led out , &quot; there is no survi@@ vor , there is no future , there is no life to be re@@ created in this form ever again . &quot;
it &apos;s dna which is pretty bad@@ ly frag@@ mented , but with good techniques now , you can basically reas@@ se@@ mble the whole genome .
so this meeting in boston led to three things . first off , r@@ yan and i decided to create a non@@ profit called re@@ vi@@ ve and re@@ store that would push de-@@ extin@@ ction generally
al@@ ber@@ to worked with the bu@@ car@@ do in sp@@ ain .
real fal@@ con@@ s out of slightly do@@ ct@@ or@@ ed chic@@ kens .
that technology will be used on de-@@ extin@@ cted animals .
so ben no@@ va@@ k , even as we speak , is jo@@ ining the group
i think that &apos;s , you know , part of how it &apos;ll work .
you , your mis@@ er@@ ab@@ len@@ ess , have got to be kid@@ ding . &quot;
have you read anything anywhere in the last week that is remo@@ tely as important as that number ? wow .
model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazili@@ an model ? -- but look at sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
you can tell politicians that these cu@@ ts &#91; can cost &#93; lives .
might we answer that cl@@ ari@@ on call with science , with reason , with facts , and , d@@ are i say it , emotions ?
or at the very least make in@@ formed decisions about what to buy .
and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-@@ tech comp@@ os@@ ites our future will be made of .
electron@@ ics k@@ its are very powerful in that they teach us how things work ,

it was actually interesting that such a communi@@ st principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defen@@ se department ,
that will not succe@@ ed .
when you pu@@ mp gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the internet .
there &apos;s no clear back@@ up system that we &apos;ve very carefully kept to be independent of the internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
i think it &apos;s extremely important that we have sustainable transport and sustainable energy production .
and then you have to have a low drag c@@ oe@@ ff@@ ici@@ ent so that you have good high@@ way range .
em : there actually are far more char@@ ging stations than people realize ,
em : well actually , i &apos;m confi@@ dent that solar will beat everything , hands down , including natural gas .
and they have an expected return on that capital .
but we managed to get through that point in 2008 .
so it &apos;s possible to achieve , let &apos;s say , roughly 10@@ 0-@@ fold impro@@ vement in the cost of spac@@ ef@@ light if you can effectively re@@ use the ro@@ cket .
i don &apos;t have a good answer for you .

well , wouldn &apos;t it be nice if it was that easy ?
but it &apos;s taken a long time to get there .
in an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon ,
please join me in than@@ king and wel@@ coming sa@@ m .
suppose we could do this instead on human cells .
i think it &apos;ll be the goal of the poe@@ ts and the mu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts and the surf@@ ers and the ban@@ kers and all the other people who join this stage and think about what we &apos;re trying to do here and why it matters .
now fast forward to just three years ago .

this means that people in my group were doing a lot of vacu@@ u@@ ming during this project .
another fac@@ et of how microbes get around is by people , and designers often clu@@ ster rooms together to fac@@ il@@ it@@ ate interac@@ tions among people , or the sharing of ideas , like in la@@ bs and in off@@ ices .
in these rooms , the air trac@@ ked the out@@ door air relatively well , and when char@@ lie saw this , he got really excited .

other people who are a little more sophisticated , using more working memory , say , &quot; i think people will pick 33 because they &apos;re going to pick a response to 50 , and so i &apos;ll pick 22 , which is two-@@ thir@@ ds of 33 . &quot;
your behavior at the end and pay you if you win .
if 10 seconds goes by and they haven &apos;t made a deal , they get nothing .
your intui@@ tion might tell you that too .
we share more genes with them than ze@@ bra@@ s do with hor@@ ses .

so here are some things we learned today .
in order to run in the general election , you must do extremely well
now , what can we say about this democracy in u@@ sa@@ -@@ land ?
i don &apos;t mean ro@@ d bla@@ go@@ je@@ v@@ ich sense of corruption .
block re@@ form .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing from the tin@@ ie@@ st sli@@ ce of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fun@@ dra@@ is@@ ing but fun@@ dra@@ ise from a wi@@ der sli@@ ce of americans , to spread it out , to spread the fun@@ der influence so that we re@@ store the idea of depen@@ dence upon the people alone .
when connec@@ tic@@ ut adop@@ ted this system , in the very first year , 7@@ 8 percent of elec@@ ted represen@@ t@@ atives gave up large contribu@@ tions and took small contribu@@ tions only .
so here &apos;s my question : do you have that love ?
the only thing i had to do was go out , pick them up , and have them stu@@ ff@@ ed for the collection .
so after six years , my friends and colleagues ur@@ ged me to publi@@ sh ,
yeah ?
i mean , the question i ask myself , why does this happen in nature ?
oh , sorry .
pay attention to not only how fun this thing is , but also how the port@@ ability that comes with this can totally change the way you interact with a city like san francisco .
if you read books of people who clim@@ b mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
and to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people le@@ gos , and we asked them to build with le@@ gos .
and if they said yes , they built it . then we asked them , &quot; do you want to build another one for $ 2.@@ 70 ? &quot;
there was a very nice cor@@ rel@@ ation between the love of le@@ gos and the amount of le@@ gos people built .
if the ceo , just like our partici@@ pants , thought the essen@@ ce of meaning is uni@@ m@@ port@@ ant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
the bad news is that ignor@@ ing the performance of people is almost as bad as sh@@ red@@ ding their effort in front of their eyes .
they took the eg@@ gs and the milk out of the po@@ w@@ der .
because in reality , it was even ug@@ lier than the first version .
is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
but if we look at the human scale , there &apos;s massive problems that aren &apos;t being addre@@ ssed by those nan@@ os@@ c@@ ale technologies .
in three dimensions , we did a project last year at ted@@ global with auto@@ des@@ k and arthur ol@@ son where we looked at autonom@@ ous parts -- so individual parts not pre-@@ connected that can come together on their own .

and later , in the mid@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s , when &quot; je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy &quot; came back on the air ,
and i would do it for nothing .
and i realized , this is it .
and you could hear that little tic@@ k , tic@@ k , tic@@ k , tic@@ k .
and as a result , a part of our brain that &apos;s supposed to do that kind of stuff
if you can &apos;t do that first step , are you really going to look up the other thousand facts you &apos;re going to need to know to master your knowledge of u.s. foreign policy ?
or your al@@ ma mat@@ er or your job , and i know just a little something about it , enough to get the ball rol@@ ling .
those are the two choices we have . i know which future i would rather be living in .
okay . and actually of those hands , if you don &apos;t include roo@@ mb@@ a how many of you have a robot at home ?
now this is a free app on the app store , so if any of you guys had this app on your phones , we could literally right now share control of the robot and play games together .

now to be clear , we &apos;re not quite ready to do this .
i pal@@ med the ball in my large right hand , and when that hand reached the ri@@ m , i felt in@@ vin@@ ci@@ ble .
i didn &apos;t mention to a@@ bed his pri@@ or driving record -- 27 viol@@ ations by the age of 25 , the last , his not shif@@ ting his truck into a low ge@@ ar on that may day —
i pulled into the town of ab@@ u gh@@ os@@ h , and bought a bri@@ ck of tur@@ k@@ ish del@@ ight : pi@@ sta@@ chi@@ os glu@@ ed in ros@@ e@@ water . better .
and was soon in k@@ far kar@@ a .
he wor@@ e black and white : sli@@ p@@ pers over so@@ cks , pil@@ ling swe@@ at@@ pants , a pie@@ b@@ ald swe@@ ater , a stri@@ ped sk@@ i ca@@ p pulled down to his fore@@ head .
i &apos;d hop@@ ed for something si@@ m@@ pl@@ er : to exchange a tur@@ k@@ ish de@@ ss@@ ert for two words and be on my way .
was it evidence of gu@@ ilt , an as@@ ser@@ tion that he should have been put away longer ?
i wis@@ h@@ ed to tell him that not only par@@ aly@@ zers and par@@ aly@@ ze@@ es must evol@@ ve , re@@ conc@@ ile to reality , but we all must -- the aging and the an@@ xi@@ ous and the di@@ vor@@ ced and the bal@@ ding and the ban@@ kru@@ pt and everyone .

not much has changed , by the way . but they thought that , if you had a neurolo@@ gic or psychiatri@@ c disease , it must be because you are pos@@ se@@ ssed by an evil spirit .

this boy is now in university and leads quite a normal life .
and then , after three months of continu@@ ous stim@@ ula@@ tion , 24 hours a day , or six months of continu@@ ous stim@@ ula@@ tion , we have a complete re@@ vers@@ al of this .
and as you go from being normal to having mil@@ d cognitive im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , which is a pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or for alzheimer &apos;s , all the way to alzheimer &apos;s disease , then there are areas of the brain that stop using glu@@ c@@ ose .
we can turn them down if they are over@@ active , if they &apos;re cau@@ sing trouble , trouble that is felt throughout the brain ,
but according to traditional estim@@ ates , if humanity had exist@@ ed for 24 hours , then writing only came along at about 11 : 0@@ 7 p@@ .@@ m .
the ge@@ tt@@ ys@@ bur@@ g address was not the main me@@ al of that event .
and so , for example , there is in tex@@ ting a conven@@ tion , which is lo@@ l .
another example is &quot; sla@@ sh . &quot;
so , &quot; from every college in the country goes up the c@@ ry , &apos; our fre@@ sh@@ men can &apos;t spel@@ l , can &apos;t pun@@ c@@ tu@@ ate . &apos; &quot; and so on . you can go even further back than this .
that &apos;d be the second thing .
and here &apos;s my theme : because of the head@@ win@@ ds , if innovation continu@@ es to be as powerful as it has been in the last 150 years , growth is cut in half .
that means we &apos;d go from 4@@ 4@@ ,000 to 18@@ 0,000 .
are we going to grow at 0@@ .@@ 8 ?
that &apos;s the percentage of american agri@@ cultural land
fast forward through the &apos; 9@@ 0s ,
the amazing thing is that produc@@ tivity did not increase in those fac@@ t@@ ories for 30 years . thir@@ ty years .
it &apos;s growing faster than it did during the second industrial revolution .
i used to teach my students that there are some things , you know , computers just aren &apos;t good at , like driving a car through traffic .
this is the great de@@ cou@@ pl@@ ing of produc@@ tivity from emplo@@ y@@ ment , of wealth from work .
technology is not de@@ stin@@ y .

you just had to do things sometimes .
and we made sure that we were still atta@@ ched to our school district for funding , for support .
because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live ?

so today i want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for impro@@ vement they want and de@@ serve .
well , to find out , our foundation has been working with 3,000 teachers in distri@@ c@@ ts across the country on a project called measu@@ res of effective teaching .
so it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflec@@ tion .
an even more important benefit for our country .
why not str@@ ang@@ ers ?
whether it &apos;s our clo@@ thes , whether it &apos;s our cars , whether it &apos;s our bi@@ kes , whether it &apos;s our books or music , we are able to take our pos@@ se@@ ssi@@ ons now and make them available to people we &apos;ve never met .
how might we think differently about our rel@@ ations with people ?
and they could -- i watched this woman for three days .
so his hands know and his intui@@ tion knows , but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be , especially
but this is not what &apos;s awesome .
in ta@@ i@@ w@@ an , at an art museum , this 12@@ -year-old girl made a mu@@ sh@@ room or@@ gan out of some mu@@ sh@@ rooms that were from ta@@ i@@ w@@ an and some electrical tape and hot glu@@ e .
ho@@ ver the mouse over the &quot; take a photo &quot; bu@@ tton , and you &apos;ve got a little cat photo boo@@ th .
and then all these professional musici@@ ans started using it ,
&lt; / doc &gt;
what we found is that , with a plan and the right people , quality of life can remain high .
having more than one incre@@ ases your chance of getting the end you want .

peter sing@@ er : the why and how of effective al@@ tru@@ ism
the fact that they &apos;re not right in front of us , the fact , of course , that they &apos;re of a different nation@@ ality or race , none of that seems mor@@ ally relevant to me .
and if you look at the words on the top ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , it says , &quot; all lives have equal value . &quot;
one person who &apos;s thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is will c@@ rou@@ ch .
i think it &apos;s clear what &apos;s the better thing to do .
you never get off , and you never really feel satis@@ fied .

because factory robots are dangerous to be around . in order to program them , you have to understand si@@ x-@@ dimensional ve@@ ctors and qu@@ ater@@ ni@@ ons .

the percentage of adults who are working age dro@@ ps drama@@ tically .

let me demonstr@@ ate the strength of this approach .
it naturally doesn &apos;t sp@@ ill , no matter what the qu@@ ad does .
the following cal@@ cu@@ lations are made every 20 milli@@ seconds , or 50 times per second .
we can use mathematical models to estim@@ ate the force that i &apos;m ap@@ pl@@ ying to the qu@@ ad .
look out for them . they &apos;re de@@ st@@ ined for great things .
i used to , to try to avoid home@@ work , sne@@ ak down to the living room and listen to my parents and their friends debate he@@ at@@ ed@@ ly .
but despite our elec@@ tor@@ al mand@@ ate , the markets mi@@ stru@@ sted us .
instead , i had a very hu@@ mb@@ ling experience .
so far , we &apos;ve thro@@ wn economics at the problem , actually mostly au@@ ster@@ ity , and certainly we could have designed altern@@ atives , a different strategy , a green stimul@@ us for green jobs , or mu@@ tu@@ alized deb@@ t , euro@@ bon@@ ds which would support countries in need from market pres@@ su@@ res ,
and i &apos;m not talking about the necessary re@@ forms of the united nations or the g@@ 20 .
help us understand how you felt after the decision .
i write fiction sci@@ -@@ fi thr@@ ill@@ ers ,
represen@@ t@@ ative government began to form .
and in that situation , si@@ f@@ ting through the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age of a su@@ ici@@ de dr@@ one attack , it will be very difficult to say who sent that weap@@ on .
now in a world of cheap , pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ating robo@@ tic weapons , bor@@ ders would offer very little protection to cri@@ tics of di@@ stant governments or trans@@ -@@ national crimin@@ al organizations .
but notice , this is more an immun@@ e system than a weapons system .
let me take you back two years ago in my life .
it was a pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment for d@@ aring to challenge the society &apos;s rules .
but what i was sure of was my inno@@ c@@ ence .
and it becomes worse when it &apos;s en@@ sh@@ r@@ ined in religious fat@@ was based on wrong interpre@@ tation of the sh@@ aria law ,
for me , i &apos;m a proud sau@@ di woman ,
it &apos;s about women themselves .
but the great rec@@ es@@ sion in 2007 and 2008 , the great crash , broke this illu@@ sion .
and this process , which is absolutely non-@@ lin@@ ear -- cannot be predic@@ ted by standard techniques -- is the reflec@@ tion of a collective emer@@ gent behavior which is fundamen@@ tally en@@ do@@ gen@@ ous .
so this is now so successful that it is used in the ini@@ tial pha@@ se of &#91; un@@ clear &#93; the flight .
we all know the chinese mi@@ rac@@ le .
now , this is interesting .
but can we really sla@@ y the dra@@ g@@ ons ?
but i do have an idea , and that idea is called hou@@ sing for health .
and it then connec@@ ts them to the bits of the physical environment that are actually needed to keep their health good .
this is a big deal , so the tic@@ ks and cros@@ ses on the screen are actually critical for young kids .
they don &apos;t work , we have to fix them .
and he came out and , within a day , it worked out that most du@@ st in this community was within a meter of the ground , the win@@ d-@@ driven du@@ st --
it was during the design of the first toilet that i went for lunch , invited by the family into their main room of the house .
people are not the problem .
the connec@@ tivity situation has impro@@ ved great@@ ly , but some barri@@ ers remain .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
we &apos;ve built a cro@@ wd map , we &apos;ve built us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
it is not without challenge .
i would w@@ ander the streets search@@ ing for food ,
when i could not fall as@@ le@@ ep from bit@@ ter cold or hun@@ ger pa@@ ins , i hop@@ ed that , the next morning , my sister would come back to wake me up with my favorite food .
i went to america without knowing a word of english ,
i felt so suff@@ oc@@ ated that i had so much food in america , yet my father died of star@@ v@@ ation .
my fo@@ ster father didn &apos;t inten@@ d to change my life .
i just wanted to say thank you for le@@ tting me be in this world .
that is , he did none of the things that might make it easy to c@@ ry fou@@ l , to put down the whole story as a pi@@ ous f@@ able .
it has to be one of the multiple iron@@ ies of history that a favorite ex@@ ple@@ tive of muslim fundamen@@ tal@@ ists is the same one once used by the chri@@ stian fundamen@@ tal@@ ists known as cru@@ sa@@ ders : &quot; in@@ fi@@ del , &quot; from the lat@@ in for &quot; fa@@ i@@ th@@ less . &quot;
and i , for one , refu@@ se to live that way .
in the nor@@ th@@ west corner of the united states , right up near the can@@ a@@ dian bor@@ der , there &apos;s a little town called li@@ bby , mont@@ ana ,
ver@@ mic@@ ul@@ ite was in the play@@ ground . it was in the foot@@ ball ground . it was in the sk@@ ating rin@@ k .
this wasn &apos;t ignor@@ ance .
and some people are blind because they think , well , seeing anything is just fu@@ ti@@ le .
and i &apos;ll never be the same . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that day back in the spring of 2006 .

more importantly , i don &apos;t have insul@@ in resistance .
all of those immun@@ e cells ru@@ shing to the site of the in@@ jury to sal@@ va@@ ge cel@@ lu@@ lar de@@ br@@ is and prevent the spread of infec@@ tion to el@@ se@@ where in the body .
i have my own ideas about what could be at the heart of this , but i &apos;m wide open to others .
first , this problem is just simply too important to continue ignor@@ ing because we think we know the answer .

thank you .
we were taught that grand story day in and day out .
those who do not are doo@@ med to fail .
now here are the facts .
in the larger central commit@@ te@@ e of 300 or more , the percentage of those who were born into power and wealth was even smaller .

now , if this is not le@@ giti@@ m@@ acy , i &apos;m not sure what is .

and part of the reason why we don &apos;t know anything at all is that the information technology systems that we use in global health to find the data to solve these problems is what you see here .
but eventually that data , hopefully , gets typ@@ ed into a computer , and someone can begin to analy@@ ze it ,
we can ski@@ p straight to the analysis and then straight to the use of the data to actually save lives . &quot;
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology ,
you can create forms , and once you &apos;ve created the forms , you push them to a variety of common mobile phones .
we &apos;ve made a lot of progress , but i recognize that right now , even the work that we &apos;ve done with 14@@ ,000 people using this is still a drop in the bu@@ cket .
and so people think of clou@@ ds as things that get in the way .
i think we should stand up for them , which is why , a few years ago , i started the cloud appreci@@ ation society .
all right . those are rar@@ er clou@@ ds than the cir@@ rus , but they &apos;re not that rare .
you &apos;re not going to change the world by lying on your back and ga@@ zing up at the sky , are you ?
and it will probably live up to its name .
nobody wants to drink blue al@@ ga@@ e-@@ cont@@ amin@@ ated water , or swi@@ m in a blue al@@ ga@@ e-@@ in@@ fe@@ sted lake .
the energy in all living things , at@@ p , is ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us@@ -@@ based .
yes , it is . what is worse is that it is very expensive .
but we are indeed hea@@ ding for a major crisis , and i ’ d like people to become aware of this problem .
it gro@@ ws much faster , and is much better designed to se@@ ek out ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us .
on the left side , you see the y@@ i@@ eld produced using conven@@ tional agriculture , with a 100 percent ph@@ os@@ ph@@ or@@ us d@@ ose .
&lt; / doc &gt;
well , he was the former oil minister of nigeria under president ab@@ ach@@ a , and it just so happens he &apos;s a con@@ vic@@ ted money la@@ under@@ er too .
now , they &apos;re all people we &apos;ve investig@@ ated , and they &apos;re all people who couldn &apos;t do what they do alone .
and then there &apos;s the problem of anony@@ mous shel@@ l companies .
and now for@@ give me , i &apos;m going to read the next bit because it &apos;s a very live issue , and our law@@ yers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 524687 &quot; &gt; els de keyser &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and that &apos;s true here in the united states .
and i think wood is going to be part of that solution , and i &apos;m going to tell you the story of why .
and what we &apos;ve developed is something we call ff@@ tt ,
in countries with de@@ forest@@ ation issues ,
it just happens to be that mother nature hol@@ ds the patent , and we don &apos;t really feel comfortable with it .
but also , it &apos;s extremely expensive , co@@ sting 800 dollars per test , and it &apos;s gr@@ os@@ s@@ ly in@@ accurate , missing 30 percent of all pan@@ creati@@ c can@@ c@@ ers .
and so then , i was sitting in class , and suddenly it hit me : i could comb@@ ine what i was reading about , carbon nano@@ tu@@ bes ,

to me , this was a little like trying to understand the ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ence of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fif@@ th symp@@ hon@@ y by abstr@@ acting the sound of a single viol@@ in player out of the context of the or@@ che@@ str@@ a and hearing just that one part .
well , i &apos;ve re@@ turned to lin@@ col@@ n mea@@ dow 15 times in the last 25 years , and i can tell you that the bi@@ op@@ hon@@ y , the den@@ sity and diversity of that bi@@ op@@ hon@@ y , has not yet re@@ turned to anything like it was before the oper@@ ation .
the good news is that , with a little bit of habitat re@@ stor@@ ation and fewer fli@@ ghts , the fro@@ g popula@@ tions , once di@@ min@@ ishing during the 198@@ 0s and early &apos; 9@@ 0s , have pretty much re@@ turned to normal .
&lt; / doc &gt;
except , all of those years i &apos;ve been there on a tou@@ ri@@ st vis@@ a ,
maybe step a little beyond some of the black and white divi@@ sions of our grand@@ parents &apos; age .
because it comes out of this almost un@@ prece@@ den@@ ted bl@@ end of cultures .
and as he had it , even the most re@@ st@@ less , di@@ str@@ acti@@ ble , te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one-@@ ad@@ d@@ led 15@@ -year-old califor@@ ni@@ an boy only had to spend three days in silence and something in him coo@@ led down and clear@@ ed out .
and i started to go back to this place ,
especially when i hear president obama often talk about the kore@@ an education system as a ben@@ ch@@ mark of success .
i also research@@ ed exten@@ si@@ vely on bo@@ ws around the world .
has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooper@@ ation and harmon@@ y among them comes a great bo@@ w .
today , their share has more than doub@@ led to above 20 percent .
all of these have contribu@@ ted to more and more income going to the very , very top .
there are super@@ star coo@@ ks and super@@ star farmers .
again , this is no m@@ ere hypothe@@ tical .
that means that our countries are getting rich@@ er , our companies are getting more efficient , but we &apos;re not creating more jobs and we &apos;re not paying people , as a whole , more .

and i came back home about four years later .
making it very cold , so at liqu@@ id hel@@ ium temper@@ atures ;
so what we do is we take conven@@ tional printing pre@@ sses , we make conduc@@ tive in@@ ks , and run those through a press , and basically just le@@ tting hundreds of thousands of elec@@ tr@@ ons flow through pieces of paper
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
so i &apos;ve made some new technology ,
well , it is the most important aspect of our lives for a very simple , lo@@ gical reason , nam@@ ely , it &apos;s a necessary condition on anything being important in our lives that we &apos;re conscious .
and i &apos;m going to go through some of them .
but they think , &quot; well , if that &apos;s it , that &apos;s an awful problem .
okay , that &apos;s the first fe@@ ature of consciousness .
and that &apos;s how nature works . that &apos;s how it &apos;s possible for consciousness to function cau@@ s@@ ally .
or is it obser@@ ver@@ -@@ rel@@ ative ?
you &apos;re giving up on 300 years of human progress and human hope and all the rest of it .
and the bit@@ co@@ ins are released , they &apos;re put into a public le@@ d@@ ger called the bloc@@ k@@ chain ,
so obviously i &apos;m looking at this through a marketing pri@@ sm , so from a brand perspective ,
it &apos;s in@@ fu@@ sed with a very complex cock@@ tail of chemicals , so it smel@@ ls very lux@@ u@@ ri@@ ous and very distin@@ c@@ tive ,
so this curren@@ cy becomes credit , which again , is really , really interesting .

and from our side , we said , &quot; what are our str@@ eng@@ ths that we really can bring to mari@@ o ? &quot;
i &apos;m five years old , and i am very proud .
and i hold this pen@@ ny in the pal@@ m of my hand ,
this is scar@@ let@@ t .
it says here that this is the ocean plane of the future .
what about the data and communication software which we need in the future ?
because what we are doing in our daily life is we train our musc@@ les , we train our skelet@@ on , and it &apos;s getting stronger .
it has everything an am@@ bu@@ lance has except for a bed .
he could have run from a block away . he could have saved this child .
when the am@@ bu@@ lance arrived 15 minutes later , i gave them over a patient who was alive .

so , for example , if i was an@@ gry and had to hide it , which i often did , being very ade@@ pt at con@@ ce@@ aling how i really felt , then the voice would sound frustr@@ ated .
they told me , for example , that if i pro@@ ved myself wor@@ thy of their help , then they could change my life back to how it had been ,
but together , they for@@ ged a bl@@ end of coura@@ ge , creativity , integr@@ ity , and an un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able belief that my sh@@ at@@ tered self could become heal@@ ed and whole .
in fact , one of the voices actually dict@@ ated the answers during the ex@@ am , which techni@@ cally possibly coun@@ ts as che@@ ating .
we are unique . we are ir@@ replac@@ e@@ able .
and as i sat in this temp@@ le square under this gigan@@ tic ber@@ ing@@ in b@@ any@@ an tree , in the dark , there was no electricity , just the full moon , down in this empty square , and i heard the most beautiful sounds , like a charles i@@ ves conc@@ ert as i listen@@ ed to the gam@@ el@@ an music from all the different villa@@ gers that came for this on@@ ce-@@ every@@ -@@ fi@@ ve-@@ years cer@@ em@@ ony . and i thought i was alone in the dark under this tree .

so try this :
chris is a great friend of mine from my university days , but secre@@ tly , i hate him .
and when she said this , i had an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any .
in fact , in the years that i gather@@ ed data , only one experience came close to being the perfect one .
it &apos;s not just the way they look , but i love the way they feel when you press down on them .
the creation of a new visual language based on the african creative her@@ it@@ age .
and is used to write am@@ har@@ ic , which is spo@@ ken by over 24 million people .
over here , you see a pal@@ e@@ o@@ graphic ch@@ art that shows what has been deci@@ pher@@ ed so far ,
and i think it was that exc@@ it@@ ement with hearing her voice hour after hour every day that made him think maybe , you know , in his brain something was sti@@ r@@ ring , some sort of musical gift .
and also you had this little ha@@ bit of hit@@ ting me out of the way .
those of you who can see will know how many notes , but derek , of course , can &apos;t .
so while we were waiting in the two hours before the re@@ he@@ ar@@ s@@ al and the conc@@ ert , derek listen@@ ed to the different version and learned it quickly and then was able to play it with the or@@ che@@ str@@ a .

it &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than i expected ,

what do we use this knowledge for ?
so yes , you do need to know a lot of stuff as a scientist ,
if there &apos;s a real r@@ ose there , those molecules will be the ones , but even if there &apos;s no r@@ ose there , you &apos;ll have the memory of a molecule .
how do we do that ? well , one of the problems , of course , turns out to be testing .
and that &apos;s a bad thing , because then you will get what you sel@@ ect for , which is what we &apos;ve gotten so far .
we &apos;ve gone from people who confron@@ ted a concrete world and analy@@ zed that world pri@@ mar@@ ily in terms of how much it would benefit them to people who confron@@ t a very complex world ,
if that mar@@ ti@@ an looked at bat@@ t@@ le@@ fields , they would find that people had only mu@@ s@@ ke@@ ts at the time of the civil war at the time of the span@@ ish@@ -@@ american war , and then they had machine gun@@ s
wher@@ ever there is always snow , the be@@ ars are white .
and you were supposed to think , well , the state leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure was r@@ ur@@ al-@@ controlled ,
i take the farm mana@@ ger of today as very different from the farm@@ er of 19@@ 00 .
if you have a principle such as , people shouldn &apos;t suff@@ er unless they &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something , then to exclu@@ de black people you &apos;ve got to make excep@@ tions , don &apos;t you ? you have to say , well , blac@@ kness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that .
and they &apos;re essentially a@@ histor@@ ical .
for a long time in my life , i felt like i &apos;d been living two different lives .
we don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
i fe@@ ared my truth , i fe@@ ared my hon@@ est@@ y , i fe@@ ared my vulner@@ ability , and that fear made me feel like i was forced into a corner ,
and we can &apos;t pro@@ cra@@ stin@@ ate on something this important .
you &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
and connec@@ ting the mountain range with the co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in is an area called the she@@ p@@ hel@@ ah , which is a series of valle@@ ys and ri@@ d@@ ges that run east to west ,
and sau@@ l says , &quot; you can &apos;t fight him . that &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
well , we call him an under@@ dog because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and go@@ li@@ ath is this big , strong giant .
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that sl@@ ing@@ ers were the deci@@ sive factor against inf@@ an@@ try in one kind of battle or another .
secon@@ dly , the bi@@ ble story makes special note of how slowly go@@ li@@ ath moves , another od@@ d thing to say when you &apos;re descri@@ bing the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est war@@ ri@@ or known to man at that point .
there &apos;s even spec@@ ula@@ tion that ab@@ ra@@ ham lin@@ col@@ n had ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
&lt; speaker &gt; kel@@ li swa@@ ze@@ y &lt; / speaker &gt;
so essentially , the shape of the building that you &apos;re born into is the shape of the structure which carri@@ es you to your ance@@ str@@ al re@@ sting place .
and what this means is that after death , we all become part of the ance@@ str@@ al line
people ask me if i &apos;m fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed or re@@ pul@@ sed by particip@@ ating in a culture where the physical manife@@ stations of death gre@@ et us at every turn .
so my name is am@@ y web@@ b , and a few years ago i found myself at the end of yet another fantastic relationship that came bur@@ ning down in a spectac@@ ular fashion .
i figure i &apos;m attrac@@ ted to maybe one out of 10 of those men ,
so obviously this was not the best way to put my most sexy foot forward .
see , the real problem here is that , while the algorithms work just fine , you and i don &apos;t , when confron@@ ted with blan@@ k windows where we &apos;re supposed to input our information online .
so i go back online now . i found je@@ wis@@ h@@ do@@ c@@ 5@@ 7
what i was trying to get at here was that i figured , in person , i would be just as competi@@ tive as a s@@ mi@@ le@@ y@@ gir@@ l@@ 197@@ 8 .
so i call my mom , i call my sister , i call my grandmother .
and i &apos;ll take her advice on that .
so i came up with the following se@@ tu@@ p .
to show this to you .
and what i have here is an empty glass ves@@ sel .
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 17@@ 8@@ 16@@ 16 &quot; &gt; jane ro@@ ffe &lt; / translator &gt;
over the past three decades , we have lived through a qui@@ et revolution .
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
you &apos;d measure how many -- el : how many books they read and how many books they continu@@ ed to read after you stopped paying them .
and that is to reason together in public about the value and the meaning of the social practic@@ es we prize ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 18@@ 37 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
and ri@@ ghtly so , in many cases .
we can show results . we can make things better .
the resources are over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly gener@@ ated by business .
that thinking has led to , i think , much of the behavior that we have come to cri@@ tici@@ ze in business , that i come to cri@@ tici@@ ze in business .
we see companies like the brazili@@ an fore@@ stry company fi@@ bri@@ a that &apos;s figured out how to avoid te@@ aring down old growth forest and using eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus and getting much more y@@ i@@ eld per he@@ ct@@ are of pul@@ p
i know it . i &apos;m seeing it .
may@@ or bloo@@ m@@ berg recogni@@ zed this when he launched plan@@ y@@ c in 2007 .
it was dangerous , hard to cross the street .
all the people arrived .
and in the three years since we &apos;ve imple@@ mented the project , re@@ tail sal@@ es have increased 17@@ 2 percent .
we protected bi@@ kers by flo@@ ating parking lan@@ es ,
the high that we &apos;ve had so far is 4@@ 4@@ ,000 in augu@@ st .
you just need to re@@ imagine your streets .
and a third re@@ turned to histor@@ ic palest@@ ine , did the second re@@ building of the temp@@ le in jer@@ us@@ al@@ em , fin@@ an@@ ced , inci@@ den@@ tally , by per@@ si@@ an ta@@ x money .
iron@@ ically , this was happening at a time when iran was more interested in peac@@ e@@ making with washington than to see to israel &apos;s destruction .
iran is germany , and a@@ h@@ ma@@ din@@ e@@ j@@ ad is hit@@ ler .
following three years of work in som@@ ali@@ a , i got picked up by the world health organization , and got as@@ signed to the epide@@ mic@@ s of aids .
we who had worked in behavior knew that pu@@ ni@@ sh@@ ment was something that was discus@@ sed but also that it was highly over@@ valu@@ ed .
and so we see that violence is , in a way , be@@ having like a con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous disease .
just like t@@ .@@ b@@ . , but the object is behavior change .
my musici@@ an friends added the word &quot; du@@ de . &quot;
thank you .
now , i know many people in this room and around the world will think , &quot; well actually , this is hard to gras@@ p , &quot; because private capit@@ alism and liber@@ al democracy
they have vast@@ ly different political systems and different economic systems ,
the evidence around il@@ liber@@ al democr@@ ac@@ ies is quite de@@ pre@@ ssing .
at its very best , the western model spea@@ ks for itself .

imagine putting everything you have into your mor@@ t@@ ga@@ ge , it goes underwater , and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you &apos;re doing .
actually , or@@ eg@@ on@@ i@@ ans spend more on alco@@ hol than most other states ,
and we finally have the studies , one in britain called &quot; glu@@ tt@@ ony versus slo@@ th &quot;
and it &apos;s almost all coming from car ex@@ ha@@ u@@ st .
to become more environmental , we move into the country , we comm@@ un@@ e with nature , we build sub@@ ur@@ bs .
we &apos;ve got the solar photo@@ vol@@ ta@@ ic system , solar hot water he@@ ater , du@@ al-@@ flu@@ sh toi@@ lets , bam@@ bo@@ o flo@@ ors .
and that &apos;s living in a wal@@ k@@ able neighborhood .

so in this picture , you can see the middle of the leg , so the bone mar@@ row , then you can see the original bone , and you can see where that original bone fin@@ ish@@ es , and just to the left of that is the new bone that &apos;s grown within that bi@@ ore@@ actor ca@@ vity ,
we z@@ oom in , we can see , even if you don &apos;t know anything about bone structure , it &apos;s beauti@@ fully organized , really beauti@@ fully organized .

there &apos;s only one little en@@ tran@@ ce to the entire building , and the 3,000 resi@@ dents come in and out through that single door .
from the main do@@ ck , people board long woo@@ den can@@ o@@ es which carry them out to their various homes and shop@@ s loc@@ ated in the ex@@ pan@@ sive area .
while to most of us , living am@@ on@@ gst these pi@@ les and pi@@ les of gar@@ bage may seem totally un@@ in@@ habit@@ able , to those in the z@@ ab@@ bal@@ een , this is just a different type of normal .
through this architecture by sub@@ tr@@ action , these ya@@ o@@ don@@ gs are built literally inside of the soil .
i sat down next to a st@@ out , midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged man with ow@@ l gla@@ sses and a bo@@ w tie ,
and for years , it seemed like we were succe@@ eding .
this time it &apos;s on the inten@@ sive care ward when a tw@@ en@@ ty@@ something resi@@ dent that i &apos;ve never met before tells me that ter@@ ence is dying , perhaps ton@@ ight .
yet i had that piece of paper .
you want to do .
we have a no@@ ble path to cur@@ ing the disease , patients and doctors ali@@ ke , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be a no@@ ble path to dying .
it &apos;s a fe@@ ature .
we asked students who were walking by to participate in a study , and we took a shot with a web@@ c@@ am ,
in another experiment , we presen@@ ted to our subjec@@ ts information about a potential job can@@ di@@ date .
now the problem is that the current policy mechanis@@ ms we have to protect ourselves from the abu@@ ses of personal information are like bringing a kni@@ fe to a gun@@ fight .
when someone tells you that privacy is in@@ comp@@ ati@@ ble with the benefits of big data , consider that in the last 20 years , researchers have created technologies to allow vir@@ tually any electron@@ ic trans@@ actions to take place in a more privac@@ y-@@ pre@@ ser@@ ving man@@ ner .
however , in the book , he also off@@ ers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden .
it felt a bit gir@@ ly to me , like a dre@@ ss , and it had this ba@@ g@@ gy trou@@ ser part you had to tie really ti@@ ght to avoid the embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment of them f@@ alling down .
but then very quickly , i started to under@@ estim@@ ate my mu@@ sta@@ che growing ability , and it got way too big .
every time i fail to become bru@@ ce lee , i become more auth@@ en@@ tically me .
we &apos;re not hea@@ ding towards one degree or three degrees or four degrees , we &apos;re hea@@ ding toward six degrees .
we know from asking people from china to the u.s. that the vast majority of people care about sustain@@ ability after the da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day issues , the da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day issues of , how do i get my kids to school ?
you save 85 percent of the electricity with an led that you would have done in an old in@@ can@@ de@@ sc@@ ent .
farmers are coming out of poverty . they love it .
we put through our business .
and this came in i@@ ke@@ a actually in the &apos; 9@@ 0s .

and indeed , a possible answer to my question op@@ ens up new univers@@ es , literally .
but whi@@ ch@@ ever it turns out to be , there is one thing i &apos;m sure of : the journey will be full of surpri@@ ses .
and yet here we were , obse@@ ssed about being wired .
our own emotions and state of mind often en@@ code time , re@@ gr@@ et or no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a about the past , hope or dre@@ ad about the future .
this digital now is not the present , because it &apos;s always a few seconds ahead , with twitter stre@@ ams that are already tr@@ ending and news from other time zones .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our wa@@ king moments in it , the challenge is to live in two stre@@ ams of time that are parallel and almost simul@@ tan@@ e@@ ous .
i wanted to learn to c@@ ook , and she kept me in the kitchen , cu@@ tting , cu@@ bing and ch@@ op@@ ping for a whole month .

what sounds like faith , so@@ ft faith , may actually be fact , because the surprising truth -- i mean , there are no studies , but the truth seems to be that these women who re@@ turned to their homes and have lived on some of the most radio@@ active land on earth for the last 27 years , have actually out@@ lived their counter@@ parts who accep@@ ted rel@@ oc@@ ation , by some estim@@ ates up to 10 years .
chris addre@@ ssed us , the scientists and experts , &quot; you have to be more pra@@ g@@ matic .
the trans@@ mission is inter@@ rup@@ ted . the engine is turned off .
the robot is transpar@@ ent , just like you would hold a young child during the first insec@@ ure steps .
and here , you can see one such example , where we la@@ bel the fi@@ bers coming from the brain in red .
maybe even without ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ ology or stim@@ ula@@ tion .
and these are examples of the kinds of programs u.s. intelligence agen@@ cies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
if the law en@@ for@@ cement is trying to find a mur@@ der@@ er , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lor@@ d or trying to prevent a school shoo@@ ting , and they have leads and they have su@@ spec@@ ts , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to ta@@ p the susp@@ ect &apos;s phone , and to inter@@ cept his internet communic@@ ations .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do ,

you shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . it &apos;s about privacy .
but maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone . maybe you can do it together with other countries .
now these numbers can be appreci@@ ated in many different ways .
now look at those numbers .
now , if we continue this process , we &apos;ll generate rec@@ t@@ ang@@ les of the form 13 by 21 , 21 by 34 , and so on .
ste@@ pping onto the si@@ de@@ walk , i then heard the sound of a steel chair slide across the concrete si@@ de@@ walk in front of me .
in particular , i thought about my dad , who had passed away from complic@@ ations from brain surgery .
let me step back and take a look at why the city is so good for the blind .
but one time i was in o@@ a@@ k@@ land
it &apos;s a different way of thinking about it , but i think it &apos;s kind of beautiful ,
&lt; speaker &gt; mic@@ k cor@@ net@@ t &lt; / speaker &gt;
our ban@@ ks began to fail .
and there we were .
and the weight came off . i lost about a p@@ ound a week for about 40 weeks .
and on that day , 1@@ 50,000 vis@@ its were plac@@ ed to our website .
really a re@@ design , re@@ thinking the way we build our infrastructure ,
the grand@@ children are coming home .
so the first thing we need is more thu@@ mb@@ s .
stand up ! it &apos;s easier if you stand up .
so you used creativity . that was great .
how many of you won just won thu@@ mb ?
what some of us may not realize is that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ yan foo@@ th@@ ills , where the climate is much war@@ mer and the landscape much green@@ er , there lives a great diversity of wild@@ life , including the one-@@ hor@@ ned r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , the a@@ si@@ an eleph@@ ant and the ben@@ g@@ al ti@@ ger .
sometimes , we fly the dr@@ one in a law@@ n@@ mo@@ wer@@ -@@ type pattern and take pictures of that area ,
because we want to keep track of the health of these habit@@ ats .
we also work with collabor@@ ators to discover new ways of using these dron@@ es .
this dr@@ one can stay in the air for 40 to 60 minutes , which gives it a range of up to 50 kilometers .
so with this focus on co@@ st-@@ cu@@ tting , i asked myself , are we for@@ getting the patient ?
if he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming in@@ continent by about 50 percent ,
very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the me@@ tal sha@@ ft in , it actually la@@ sted a lot longer ,
now , if the american healthcare system would focus a lot more on meas@@ uring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average oe@@ c@@ d , it would save the american people 500 billion u.s. dollars a year .
that &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be compar@@ ing app@@ les to app@@ les , not only within a country , but between countries .

i went even further by seeing if i could use a head@@ -@@ moun@@ ted disp@@ lay , the o@@ cul@@ us ri@@ ft , as modi@@ fied by fighting wal@@ rus , to have an im@@ mer@@ sive experience control@@ ling the dr@@ one .
actually , that &apos;s not true .
imagine you are in a mat@@ ern@@ ity ward in mal@@ i , and have a new@@ born in need of ur@@ gent medic@@ ation .
the ground stations are loc@@ ated on safe loc@@ ations
compare this to normal infrastructure invest@@ ments .
in the developed world and the emerging world , we would hope it would become a new mo@@ de of transpor@@ tation that could help make our cities more li@@ vable .
ourselves . most old people in the u.s. end up living separ@@ ately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years ,
still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , bas@@ ke@@ ts , po@@ ts and tex@@ ti@@ les .
there have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse .
one value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grand@@ parents for off@@ ering high-@@ quality child@@ care to their grand@@ children , if they choose to do it ,
the lives of the el@@ der@@ ly are wi@@ del@@ y recogni@@ zed as constitu@@ ting a disaster area of modern american society .
so yesterday , i was out in the street in front of this building ,
so here &apos;s the words : tree , high@@ way , mirror , satur@@ n and electro@@ de .
it &apos;s limited in capacity , limited in du@@ ration ,
it &apos;s a way of processing what &apos;s going on so that we can use it later .
the support may come in asking people questions , giving them a s@@ heet of paper that has an organi@@ z@@ ational ch@@ art on it or has some gu@@ iding images ,
if all brains were made the same way and you were to compare animals with brains of different si@@ zes , larger brains should always have more neurons than smaller brains , and the larger the brain , the more cogni@@ tively able its ow@@ ner should be .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
so this brings us to a very important conclu@@ sion already , which is that we are not ro@@ dents . the human brain is not a large rat brain .
and we looked for the combin@@ ations of body size and number of brain neurons that a pri@@ mate could afford if it ate a certain number of hours per day .
my answer is that we have the largest number of neurons in the cer@@ e@@ br@@ al cortex , and i think that &apos;s the simp@@ le@@ st explan@@ ation for our remarkable cognitive abilities .
when you are happy , you are grat@@ eful . but think again .
something that &apos;s really valuable to me and i realize it &apos;s fre@@ ely given , then grat@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness spont@@ an@@ e@@ ously ri@@ ses in my heart ,
and if you miss the opportunity of this moment , another moment is given to us , and another moment .
to learn , to suff@@ er , to stand up , all these opportunities are given to us ,
and every time i turned it on , water .
it can change our world in im@@ mensel@@ y important ways ,
and if this has contribu@@ ted a little to making you want to do the same , stop , look , go .
the idea is called the social impact b@@ ond .
inve@@ stors get two opportunities : for the first time , they can invest in social change .
so what &apos;s caused this exc@@ it@@ ement ?
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 239@@ 26@@ 3 &quot; &gt; el@@ is@@ a@@ beth buff@@ ard &lt; / reviewer &gt;
well , animals do and can provide extremely useful information .
they &apos;ve tried many different approach@@ es .
they stick , and then they try to go into the lun@@ g side from blood channel .
now we can begin to create models of diseases such as ir@@ rit@@ able bo@@ wel syn@@ dro@@ me .
we could use them to learn more about diseases such as ebola or other dead@@ ly diseases such as s@@ ars .
like the prototype you see there , put the car@@ tri@@ dge into the machine just like you would a c@@ .@@ d@@ . , and away you go .
i debate people who literally want to ob@@ liter@@ ate everything i believe in , in some cases , who don &apos;t want me and people like me to even exist .
in other words , we can be poli@@ tically right but emo@@ tionally wrong .
but he &apos;s listening , not because of what i said , but because of how i said it , and somehow , even though we &apos;ve never met , we &apos;ve managed to form a connection .
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
but the actual robot is really only half the story .
if more money is inve@@ sted in high@@ ways , of course there is less money for hou@@ sing , for schools , for hospitals ,
a commit@@ te@@ e of 12@@ -year-old children would find out in 20 minutes that the most efficient way to use scar@@ ce road space is with exclu@@ sive lan@@ es for bu@@ ses .
they are a right , just as si@@ de@@ walks are , unless we believe that only those with access to a motor vehicle have a right to safe mo@@ bility , without the risk of getting killed .
they could go for do@@ zens of kilometers sa@@ f@@ ely without any risk in wonderful green@@ ways , sort of bic@@ y@@ cle high@@ ways , and i would inv@@ ite you to imagine the following : a city in which every other street would be a street only for pe@@ de@@ stri@@ ans and bic@@ y@@ cles .
they can create a much happ@@ ier life for billions towards the future .
we are more depen@@ dent on it now than ever .
they don &apos;t have time to rel@@ a@@ x .
in terms of carbon emissions per ton per mile , it em@@ its about a thous@@ and@@ th of a@@ vi@@ ation and about a ten@@ th of tru@@ cking .
i &apos;d been well treated by the cre@@ w , i &apos;d had a gar@@ r@@ ul@@ ous and enter@@ ta@@ ining cap@@ tain , and i would happ@@ ily have signed up for another five weeks ,
but my father wanted me to learn how to read and write .
my people build all the time with cla@@ y , but they don &apos;t see any innovation with mu@@ d .
with my team , and it works .
i came to speak to you like that .
when i was a kid , i was going to school , i was coming back every ho@@ li@@ day to gand@@ o .
the second most exciting thing for a cave explor@@ er is to be the first one to make a map of a cave .
this is me looking into the en@@ tran@@ ce cre@@ vas@@ se .
there &apos;s our camp on the left side of this en@@ tran@@ ce room .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 239@@ 26@@ 3 &quot; &gt; el@@ is@@ a@@ beth buff@@ ard &lt; / reviewer &gt;
but it was a defin@@ ing time for me as a young boy .
and then one day we were out together , and he came across the trac@@ ks of where a female le@@ op@@ ard had walked .
it &apos;s sha@@ king me viol@@ ently .
this is the other thing about sol@@ ly , he &apos;s fre@@ a@@ k@@ ish@@ ly strong .
and then we would come around the corner , and there she would be with her her@@ d .
but i just wonder@@ ed if you wanted to share any addi@@ tional thoughts , because we know that you heard that news just before coming in to do this se@@ ssion .
i do . i was a young boy , and my grand@@ father had just died ,
and the phra@@ se i heard most often was that grand@@ dad was now &quot; up there looking down on us , &quot; and if i should die too , which wouldn &apos;t happen of course , then i too would go up there ,
twice as likely .
but be@@ tting everything on the idea of finding the eli@@ x@@ ir and sta@@ ying alive forever is a ri@@ sky strategy .
and the pur@@ suit of f@@ ame is as wi@@ de@@ spread and popular now as it ever was ,
now , i find it helps to see life as being like a book :
as it had top@@ ped the list of american sh@@ rin@@ king cities .
that are living in mid@@ western cities like de@@ tro@@ it .
so if we take all of that vac@@ ant and ab@@ and@@ oned property and we s@@ mu@@ sh it together , it looks like about 20 square miles ,
now we have community ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship happening in neighbor@@ hoods , we have cultural entreprene@@ urs making decisions to move to the city and create enter@@ pri@@ ses , and we have businesses rel@@ oc@@ ating ,
and actually ac@@ qu@@ ire property so they were actually property ow@@ ners as well as business ow@@ ners in the communities with which they resi@@ ded .
so today , i &apos;m here to ask you to think of how the future is happening now .
it &apos;s a world where information itself becomes intelligent and comes to us automati@@ cally when we need it without having to look for it .
that seems tri@@ vi@@ al , but it &apos;s less time spent car@@ ing for patients .
imagine a field engineer arri@@ ving at the wind farm with a hand@@ held device telling her which tur@@ bin@@ es need serv@@ ic@@ ing .
there are people who argue that today &apos;s innovation is all about social media and sil@@ ly games , with no@@ where near the transforma@@ tional power of the industrial revolution .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and the reality is that if you don &apos;t have much money , like this young named kam@@ al right here , the option you really have is a bam@@ bo@@ o staff to get around .
re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of your income level , you want the most beautiful , the best product that there is .
so this is it right here .
because if you want to scale , if you want to reach all the people in the world who possibly need a k@@ nee , it needs to be econom@@ ically sustainable .

it was 15 more hours , which for most swi@@ mmers would be a long time .
it was a very real moment , with that cro@@ wd , with my team .
thank you .
rich player : are you serious . poor player : yeah .
rich player 2 : i &apos;m going to buy out this whole board .
they &apos;re in studies . this is for them .
but over the last 20 years , that significant difference has become a grand c@@ any@@ on of sorts between those at the top and everyone else .
bill gates , one of our nation &apos;s weal@@ th@@ ie@@ st individuals , in his harvard com@@ men@@ cement speech , talked about the problem facing society of ine@@ quality as being the most da@@ un@@ ting challenge ,
i &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
dr. ru@@ dy lei@@ bel of colum@@ bia university has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight bur@@ n 250 to 400 cal@@ ories less because their metaboli@@ sm is sup@@ pressed .
even if they started at a normal weight ,
i &apos;m not saying you need to learn to medi@@ t@@ ate
even at its best , die@@ ting is a waste of time and energy .
now , my dad &apos;s doing better today ,
in other words , are the side effects just so sever@@ e that no matter how much good it does , it &apos;s not going to be worth it ?
so we kind of created a new problem by solving the old one .
but it wasn &apos;t until we actually got the popular press interested in this that we began to get some tr@@ action .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 19@@ 0@@ 2 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
of course , the more you go in the past , the less information you will have .
actually probably 10 billion events can be extr@@ ac@@ ted from this archi@@ ve .
it &apos;s difficult . one thing you can do is document each step of the process ,
i thank you very much .
so this is not a play@@ list or a list of son@@ gs inten@@ ded for the park , but rather an ar@@ ray of distin@@ ct mel@@ o@@ dies and rhy@@ th@@ ms that fit together like pieces of a puzzle and bl@@ end se@@ am@@ less@@ ly based on a listen@@ er &apos;s ch@@ os@@ en tra@@ jec@@ tory .
which is , &quot; if you continue to oper@@ ate in your own self-@@ interest you will do the best good for society . &quot;

it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .

now , related to this is another key issue , which is need@@ le@@ stick in@@ ju@@ ries .
so let &apos;s start with the first one , this im@@ mu@@ no@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity idea .
however , you still don &apos;t really know if a vaccine is going to work until you roll your sle@@ e@@ ves up and vaccin@@ ate and wait .
now , of course , we &apos;ve worked within my lab with many other vacc@@ ines that have atta@@ ined similar respon@@ ses and similar cur@@ ves to this , what we &apos;ve achie@@ ved with influ@@ en@@ za .
yet , that vaccine is not available in large numbers because it &apos;s too expensive .
but i also had noticed that it wasn &apos;t working .
my husband read it and he was like , this is like eating your whe@@ aties .
ss : i mean , i &apos;m grat@@ eful , i &apos;m hon@@ or@@ ed , i &apos;m happy , and it &apos;s the very beginning .
pm : and you did focus in the book -- and the reason , as you said , in writing it , was to create a di@@ alo@@ gue about this .
i looked at them , we went around and introduced ourselves , and they all said their names and where they &apos;re from ,
and it &apos;s part of what ted@@ women does .

in the end , i accep@@ ted the job without actually having been here .
you should have seen the looks .
and then the play between -- actually really quite carefully disp@@ os@@ ed color and gil@@ ding , and the sculp@@ tur@@ al surface , is really rather remarkable .
then , i think we &apos;ve started doing the same .

and then there are men and women who cross the he@@ ter@@ os@@ ex@@ u@@ al line , who have sex with their own sex , or who have a different gender identity .
a thousand years ago , we used to have whole dic@@ tion@@ aries of sex in arab@@ ic .

she no longer dan@@ ced .
now , it was only 20 years ago that we har@@ dly had any data on women &apos;s health beyond our re@@ productive func@@ tions .
and what we found was that lin@@ da &apos;s disease didn &apos;t look like the typical male disease .
sa@@ dly , dan@@ a and hun@@ g we@@ i died of their disease .
our investig@@ ators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with m@@ ood .
thank you .
the so@@ ft -- feelings , sen@@ ti@@ ments , inter@@ personal relationships , tra@@ its , person@@ ality .

so who is left ? the employees , who have to comp@@ ens@@ ate through their super individual effor@@ ts for the lack of cooper@@ ation .
and we go for a second tv or we es@@ cal@@ ate the decision above for ar@@ bit@@ ration .
you must give more cards to people so that they have the critical mass of cards to take the risk to cooper@@ ate , to move out of in@@ su@@ lation .

we were obviously making a difference .
and as a par@@ ent , i get it .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : we &apos;re all familiar with satellite ima@@ gery , but what we might not know is that much of it is out of date . that &apos;s because satel@@ lit@@ es are big and expensive , so there aren &apos;t that many of them up in space . as he explains in this fascinating talk , dan ber@@ ken@@ stock and his team came up with a different solution , designing a cheap , ligh@@ twe@@ ight satellite with a radic@@ ally new approach to photograph@@ ing what &apos;s going on on earth .

in light of this observ@@ ation on con@@ temporary love , how can we think of love in the years to come ?
how to ren@@ oun@@ ce the hy@@ ster@@ ical need to be valu@@ ed ?
for a couple who is no longer susta@@ ined , suppor@@ ted by the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of tradition , i believe that self-@@ mo@@ c@@ ker@@ y is one of the best means for the relationship to end@@ ure .
and it &apos;s how you use the material
when we &apos;re talking about sustain@@ ability ,
that have been there for years , all right ?

they seem lo@@ gical , right ? yeah .
now , this is a technology aren@@ a , so obviously these things are quite popular , but i think if we &apos;re going to keep designing , buying and using and thro@@ wing out these kinds of products at the rate we currently do , which is astronom@@ ically high ,

we might be able to feed the front row .
you may be asking yourself , is my company helping me to pre@@ p@@ are to be a great 21@@ st-@@ century leader ?
in fact , traditional asse@@ ss@@ ments like nar@@ row 3@@ 60 surve@@ ys or out@@ d@@ ated performance cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a will give you fal@@ se posi@@ tives , l@@ ul@@ ling you into thinking that you are more prepared than you really are .
they &apos;re often people that think differently and therefore are willing to join you in taking a coura@@ ge@@ ous lea@@ p .

the second things is very hot .
what &apos;s happened is a partic@@ le acceler@@ ator at a huge , huge scale .
they are not faster hor@@ ses .
and i would like to focus in particular on these s@@ over@@ eig@@ n rat@@ ings .
the custom@@ ers of these r@@ ating agen@@ cies , like countries or companies , they are paying for their own rat@@ ings , and obviously this is creating a conflict of interest .
but we also have to ask the question , who is cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ating the economic soil of a country , right ?
because for way too long , we have left the big financial players on their own .
gam@@ ma is just one of these companies .
&#91; &quot; while your target is brow@@ sing the web , ex@@ changing docu@@ ments , recei@@ ving sms , cros@@ sing the bor@@ ders &quot; &#93; you have to hit many different plat@@ forms .

and the awful thing is , there are so many other examples out there from all walks of life .
and the other , even better , i &apos;m afraid that &apos;s america .
but the fun doesn &apos;t have to end there , maybe you want to be even more anony@@ mous .
but this was an awful trage@@ dy , and it shouldn &apos;t have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those dea@@ ths .

the reality is , the folks i described as the master teachers , the master narrative buil@@ ders , the master story@@ tel@@ lers are far re@@ moved from class@@ rooms .

well that would look something like this .
boom , we get planets or@@ b@@ iting about it .
thank you .
none of the straight lines are actually straight .
i was asked at this time to design a series of con@@ den@@ sed s@@ ans ser@@ if types with as many different vari@@ ants as possible
so the challenge for me was to design type that per@@ formed as well as possible in these very ad@@ verse production conditions .
&quot; oh , &quot; he said . &quot; what problem ? &quot;

i didn &apos;t think about that much at the time ,
and we did three key things .
and because we use stere@@ o , we can capture all the statistics on how big the shark is , what angle it comes in at , how quickly it leaves , and what its behavior is in an empi@@ ri@@ cal rather than a subjec@@ tive way .

so just to back up and explain , the only thing i have ever wanted to be for my whole life was a writer .

understanding how they interact together to make that neuron work ,

all so that they could achieve more than we could ever imagine for ourselves .

a female dog in heat sent an invisible signal to male dogs for miles around , and it wasn &apos;t a sound , it was a smell .
as any dog ow@@ ner can tell you , we smell , they smell .
now , smell was the har@@ dest of the sen@@ ses to cr@@ ack ,
and so inci@@ den@@ tally , if you want to reduce the amount of smell , clear@@ -@@ cu@@ tting your ar@@ mp@@ its is a very effective way of reduc@@ ing the habitat for bacteria ,
and these are the little bu@@ mp@@ s around the ni@@ p@@ ple ,
there could be all sorts of medical interven@@ tions .

you don &apos;t have to believe in a god per se , just in being je@@ wish . &quot; so if this guy is a ra@@ bb@@ i , and a je@@ wish ra@@ bb@@ i , and if you have to believe in god in order to be religious , then we have the rather counter@@ intui@@ tive conclu@@ sion
i think the answer is a pretty simple one and therefore cru@@ de and con@@ ten@@ tious .
of a set of assump@@ tions that were religious , chri@@ stian assump@@ tion@@ s. of the natural world that didn &apos;t say something about its relationship , for example , to the creation story in the ab@@ ra@@ ha@@ mic tradition , the creation story in the first book of the tor@@ ah .

a beautiful song can play , a pretty girl could walk by , they don &apos;t care , but they see a cros@@ s@@ bar to a capital a ,
and jen@@ n@@ ings and the other guy didn &apos;t get that .
we &apos;re going to again exp@@ and our ne@@ o@@ cortex , only this time we won &apos;t be limited by a fix@@ ed architecture of en@@ clos@@ ure .
this turned out not to be true , but this idea of per@@ va@@ sive black hom@@ op@@ ho@@ bia set in , and was gra@@ b@@ bed on by the media .
and it gal@@ van@@ ized the civil rights movement like nothing had before it .
the first one was in 197@@ 9 , and the second one took place in 198@@ 7 .
and it looks at how the afri@@ can@@ -@@ american community is grap@@ pl@@ ing with the gay rights issue in light of the gay marriage movement and this fight over the meaning of civil rights .

and so the syri@@ an electron@@ ic army is a pro@@ -@@ as@@ sad group of hackers who support his con@@ ten@@ tious regime .
so i think it &apos;s time we take a good look at how we choose to portra@@ y them , because if we keep expe@@ cting them to be the bad guys , how can they be the heroes too ?
who has the authority to make those kinds of offici@@ al decisions about words , anyway ?

when you do things like that , and we also developed things that take physical photographs that are instan@@ tly prin@@ table , it will make it easier to create content ,

now here &apos;s the problem , though : some people had long pass@@ words that actually weren &apos;t very strong .
so we did the research study to see what would actually happen .
they &apos;re the pass@@ words that they created or the computer created for them for our study .

in fact , they would contrast science with faith ,
according to the standard model , the tex@@ t@@ book model , scientists develop hypothe@@ ses , they de@@ duce the consequences of those hypothe@@ ses , and then they go out into the world and they say , &quot; okay , well are those consequences true ? &quot;
it &apos;s just not true . and i &apos;m going to talk about three reasons why it &apos;s wrong .
the first was an assump@@ tion about the size of the earth &apos;s or@@ bit .
one of the things scientists want to do in life is to explain the causes of things .
and the answer is a model that inclu@@ des , it &apos;s the answer e on that sat , all of the above .
but this leads us to one final problem : if science is what scientists say it is , then isn &apos;t that just an appe@@ al to authority ?
our trust in science , like science itself , should be based on evidence , and that means that scientists have to become better communic@@ ators .
i remember one day , i said to her , &quot; it &apos;s oc@@ tober 1 today , &quot;

i swe@@ ar that as i get older , my ideas become si@@ m@@ pl@@ er and more and more chil@@ dish .

it &apos;s something that you might find easy to do and you might even find enjo@@ y@@ able and even hel@@ p@@ ful to do ,

and then he en@@ li@@ sted in the french military in world war ii .

i don &apos;t think it &apos;s an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to say that the major cat@@ aly@@ st in america for moral change has been a situation com@@ edy .
our reason could cause us to over@@ ride our pas@@ sions .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : when he was a child , george ta@@ ke@@ i and his family were forced into an intern@@ ment camp for japan@@ e@@ se-@@ americans , as a &quot; security &quot; measure during world war ii . 70 years later , ta@@ ke@@ i looks back at how the camp shaped his surprising , personal definition of patri@@ o@@ tis@@ m and democracy .
my brother and i were in the living room looking out the front window ,
being in a prison , a bar@@ bed@@ -@@ wire prison camp , became my norm@@ ality .
and so i engaged my father after dinner in long , sometimes he@@ ated convers@@ ations .
they said that they were going to fight not only to get their families out from behind those bar@@ bed@@ -@@ wire f@@ ences , but because they ch@@ er@@ ished the very ide@@ al of what our government stands for , should stand for , and that was being ab@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by what was being done .
the men clim@@ bed for eight hours straight ,

but other families were so much less lucky ,
in fact , many people of muslim her@@ it@@ age around the world are sta@@ unch op@@ pon@@ ents both of fundamen@@ tal@@ ism and of terrorism , and often for very good reason .

the men who cut her thro@@ at then told everyone else , &quot; if you go to university , the day will come when we will kill all of you just like this . &quot;
we don &apos;t have the right to be sil@@ ent about them because it is easier or because western policy is fla@@ wed as well ,
now , how come that ide@@ ology of choice is still so powerful , even among people who have not many things to choose among ?
now , because of this , people have now more and more problems that they are not cho@@ os@@ ing anything .
but surpri@@ sing@@ ly , people are more and more turning a blind eye in front of this knowledge .
sometimes they don &apos;t embr@@ ace it , again identi@@ fying with the idea of choice , but they have nothing to choose from .
now , i started with a quote from sam@@ u@@ el john@@ son , who said that when we make choice in life , we shouldn &apos;t forget to live .
but there is a tra@@ de-@@ off , because these inci@@ sions are created with a long , pointed device called a tro@@ car .

he &apos;s a big belie@@ ver in education .
we set out to build a model that will cut down almost entirely the cost of higher education ,
this way , we open our students &apos; minds , we develop a positive shift in at@@ titude toward different cultures .
from being a privilege for the few to becoming a basic right , af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ac@@ ces@@ sible for all .
and now cla@@ thr@@ in is basically done with its job , and so prote@@ ins are coming in now — we &apos;ve covered them yellow and oran@@ ge — that are responsible for taking apart this cla@@ thr@@ in ca@@ ge .
it can change the way that we communicate with one another , how we explore our data and how we teach our students .

pion@@ eer@@ ed by mu@@ ham@@ mad y@@ un@@ us ,
let me tell you one more story .
— hold on , i &apos;m not there !
once , he jump@@ ed out of our third floor apart@@ ment .
but any of you in relationships — at least this is my case — just because you ask someone that you &apos;re with or your par@@ ent or your child how they feel doesn &apos;t mean that they can tell you .
they &apos;ll develop fix@@ ations like ch@@ as@@ ing their ta@@ ils comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely .
can@@ ine veter@@ ans of conflic@@ ts of iraq and afghanistan are coming back with what &apos;s considered can@@ ine p@@ ts@@ d ,
for many months , up to i think two years after that inci@@ dent , she was so sc@@ ared she couldn &apos;t be in the house when anyone was clean@@ ing .
he became extremely prote@@ c@@ tive of these bun@@ ni@@ es ,
and not just for to@@ xic@@ ity but for behavi@@ oral effects .
those are the things that often tend to help the most , especially when combin@@ ed with psych@@ op@@ har@@ mac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als .
but what &apos;s so interesting to me about lon@@ nie and g@@ ander &apos;s relationship is about a few months in ,
and my theme was this : our earth has exist@@ ed for 45 million centu@@ ries , but this one is special —
so as i said in my book , we &apos;ll have a bu@@ mp@@ y ride through this century .
it &apos;s an important ma@@ x@@ im that the un@@ familiar is not the same as the im@@ prob@@ able ,
at 17 , a boy from my high school cir@@ cul@@ ated an email deta@@ iling all the sexu@@ ally aggre@@ ssive things he could do to me because i didn &apos;t pay attention to him .
and at a time when most of us here were prepar@@ ing to wel@@ come the new year , india pl@@ un@@ ged into dar@@ kness .
three , i realized for the first time that my voice mat@@ tered .
she said she was stal@@ ked , gro@@ ped , and ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ated at .
and i ex@@ pressed my re@@ gr@@ et for what she had fac@@ ed .
the truth is , the end to this problem begins with us .
why our universe is continu@@ ing to exp@@ and , and what is this mysteri@@ ous dark energy that drives that ex@@ pan@@ sion ?
the hu@@ bble space telescope : for the last 25 years it &apos;s been producing some of the most deta@@ iled vie@@ ws of our di@@ stant universe , but if you tried to use the hu@@ bble to create an image of the sky , it would take 13 million individual images ,
but the systems we &apos;re finding aren &apos;t much like our own solar system ,
now , distance and changes in our universe — distance equ@@ ates to time , as well as changes on the sky .
they all are consi@@ stent with the 42 points , but the ideas behind these lines are drama@@ tically different .

she we@@ ars red patent shoes , and her man@@ tra is that one scar@@ f is nice but two is better .
j@@ c : first of all , i never like to pre@@ su@@ me to speak for the ted community , but i would like to tell you that i have a feeling we can all agree that you are still char@@ ming , se@@ duc@@ tive and sexy . yes ?
the other day , one of my co@@ workers asked me if i could save that file as a p@@ d@@ f ,
ph@@ ara@@ oh had his sla@@ ves move millions of blocks just to this site to er@@ ect a big fre@@ a@@ king head@@ stone .
you &apos;re dam@@ n right , it was .
jim hol@@ t : why does the universe exist ?
but for lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z , who asked why is there something rather than nothing , this was not a great myster@@ y .
if we let our desi@@ res m@@ elt away , we &apos;ll see the world for what it truly is , a vacu@@ ity , no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness ,
they don &apos;t exist outside the world .
so we have this vast@@ ly rich multi@@ verse that en@@ compas@@ ses every lo@@ gical possibility .
the ful@@ le@@ st possible reality , that &apos;s special .
if you can compu@@ te it by looking at the number of the genes and the number of all@@ el@@ es and so forth , and a back@@ -@@ of-@@ the-@@ en@@ vel@@ op@@ e cal@@ cu@@ lation will tell you there are about 10 to the 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0@@ th possible humans , gene@@ tically .
just a bru@@ te fact .
i mean , lies ! but seriously , we all say we hate this cra@@ p .
be a hero . this is your chance .
i fe@@ ared that my father would die before i had a chance to kill him .
to that end , ba@@ ge@@ ye and his friends , mostly j@@ ama@@ ic@@ an , exhi@@ b@@ ited a kind of j@@ ama@@ ic@@ an bel@@ la fig@@ ur@@ a : turn your best side to the world , show your best face to the world .
but when i am working in my house and writing , after a day &apos;s writing , i ru@@ sh down@@ sta@@ irs and i &apos;m very excited to talk about mar@@ cus gar@@ ve@@ y or bob mar@@ ley and words are tri@@ pping out of my mouth like bu@@ tter@@ flies and i &apos;m so excited that my children stop me , and they say , &quot; dad , nobody car@@ es . &quot;
he thought , &quot; i know how to drive ; why do i need the state &apos;s v@@ ali@@ d@@ ation ? &quot;
i was not surprised to hear the psychiatri@@ st say , &quot; black people are sch@@ oo@@ led in par@@ an@@ o@@ ia . &quot;
and i even began to feel that this book may be percei@@ ved by my father as an act of fi@@ li@@ al de@@ vo@@ tion .
this is a photograph of me , nine months old .
i &apos;m an industrial engineer .
once plan@@ ted , we use gra@@ ss or ri@@ ce stra@@ w to cover the soil
as usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up ,
the really cool advan@@ ce with func@@ tional ima@@ ging happened when scientists figured out how to make pictures that show not just an@@ atom@@ y but activity , that is , where neurons are fir@@ ing .
so the next question was , what does this thing really do ?
your face met@@ am@@ or@@ ph@@ os@@ ed .
yes , we do .
i could take any of you , pop you in the scanner , and find each of those regions in your brain , and it would look a lot like my brain , although the regions would be slightly different in their exact location and in their size .

which is this . this is the former tro@@ l@@ ley ter@@ min@@ al that was the de@@ pot for pas@@ sen@@ gers traveling over the willi@@ am@@ s@@ bur@@ g bridge from broo@@ kl@@ yn to manhattan ,

sometimes , in my project , i would take the painting and give it new meaning and new temp@@ tation about it .
please answer a , b or c .
but it was close .
and in u.s. , when we asked the public , only five percent got it right .
and that is very clearly shown in this question .
it was not represen@@ t@@ ative . okay ?
and in this case , the ch@@ im@@ ps use our intui@@ tion against us , and it becomes our wea@@ kness instead of our strength .
that will never happen , actually .
no — well , yes , but they are not so important in the global statistics , that is what i &apos;m saying .
the western domin@@ ation is over , as of today .
the artist must know the man@@ ner where@@ by to convince others of the tru@@ th@@ ful@@ ness of his lies . &quot;
and — — she went tru@@ d@@ ging through the i@@ vy , and then her eyes just got so wide , and she pointed out this mel@@ on that was bigger than her head , and then all the kids ran over there and ru@@ shed around her ,
it &apos;s at 8@@ 26 val@@ en@@ cia street in the mission in san francisco ,
we have some patent medic@@ ines , can@@ op@@ ic j@@ ars for your organs , communi@@ st so@@ ap that says , &quot; this is your so@@ ap for the year . &quot; our slu@@ sh@@ y machine broke on the opening night and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s almost as old as story@@ telling itself .
so what eli@@ ot and the other kids who send these in get back is a letter in very small print from a nor@@ we@@ gi@@ an law fir@@ m — — that says that due to a change in custom@@ s laws ,
and i &apos;m calling you to just say , to wish you a mer@@ ry christ@@ mas .
it &apos;s now a her@@ it@@ age building , but it did not pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ate .
and we looked at lower manhattan .
thank you .
it &apos;s become a spra@@ w@@ ling urban area depen@@ dent on dir@@ ty fuel , dir@@ ty energy , particularly coal .
the emissions of green@@ house g@@ ases would rise , with im@@ men@@ se risks to our climate .
i &apos;ve already described the problems of be@@ ij@@ ing : pollution , con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on , waste and so on .
you can see that the two transforma@@ tions i &apos;ve described , the structur@@ al and the climate , come very much together .
we &apos;ll see , but what you &apos;re seeing now is people moving much more quickly .
you &apos;re seeing what can be done .
and we hand@@ ed that report yesterday here in new york , in the united nations building to the secre@@ tar@@ y-@@ general of the u.@@ n. , ban ki@@ -@@ moon .

in the 19@@ 50@@ s , a computer scientist at ib@@ m named arthur sam@@ u@@ el liked to play chec@@ kers ,

who was a public serv@@ ant .
i don &apos;t understand why i &apos;m being passed over . &quot;
and then they pretty much stopped .
so what &apos;s women &apos;s experience as it rel@@ ates to men@@ tor@@ ing ?
to make sure that the missing 33 percent is appropri@@ ately emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zed ,
it started a couple of years ago .
and i do fir@@ m@@ ly believe that we can keep listening like these seven@@ -year-old children , even when growing up .
you can actually see it in this video here .
we &apos;ve la@@ bel@@ ed the blood ves@@ sels in red , and the c@@ s@@ f that &apos;s surr@@ ounding the brain will be in green .
and while it &apos;s important to point out that these studies don &apos;t prove that lack of sleep or poor sleep cause alzheimer &apos;s disease , they do suggest that the failure of the brain to keep its house clean by clear@@ ing away waste like am@@ y@@ lo@@ id@@ -@@ bet@@ a may contribu@@ te to the development of conditions like alzheimer &apos;s .
and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many .
but , we also must ad@@ mit that we haven &apos;t been good at using those same networks and technologies to success@@ fully artic@@ ul@@ ate an alternative to what we &apos;re seeing and find the con@@ sen@@ sus and build the al@@ li@@ an@@ ces that are needed to make it happen .
it suddenly became very easy for us to simply compare these results with how our represen@@ t@@ atives were vo@@ ting in congress .
so , even if that wasn &apos;t enough to win a seat in congress , it was enough for us to become part of the conversation , to the ex@@ tent that next month , congress , as an institu@@ tion , is laun@@ ching for the first time in ar@@ gent@@ ina &apos;s history , a democr@@ ac@@ y@@ os to disc@@ u@@ ss , with the citizens , three pieces of leg@@ is@@ lation : two on urban transpor@@ tation and one on the use of public space .

that has been recogni@@ zed in social science and in liter@@ ature and in religion and in vir@@ tually every field of discipline .
the first of which is that the only people who care about privacy , the only people who will se@@ ek out privacy , are by definition bad people .
bg : i &apos;m curious about your relationship with ed sno@@ wden , because you have spo@@ ken with him a lot , and you certainly continue doing so , but in your book , you never call him ed@@ ward , nor ed , you say &quot; sno@@ wden . &quot; how come ?
bg : g@@ len@@ n , thank you very much . g@@ g : thank you very much .
i think you &apos;ll agree with me that that &apos;s a pretty useful public health interven@@ tion .
children pick up disease in the place that &apos;s supposed to love them and protect them the most , in their homes .
to ref@@ ine this behavior .
without it , and without talking about it , we cannot achieve the change that we need .
but after a few weeks of treatment , again her health wasn &apos;t getting any better .
to explain what mic@@ r@@ or@@ n@@ as are and their important role in cancer , i need to start with prote@@ ins , because when cancer is present in our body , protein modi@@ fic@@ ation is obser@@ ved in all can@@ cer@@ ous cells .
if we can have a camera here so you can see my screen .
that is , at stage 3 or 4 , and i believe that is too late .
but there &apos;s one question that always seems to me to be most reve@@ aling , and that is : what did you take ?
i took this picture of this little girl .
every day , on average , by the end of this day , 3@@ 2,000 people will be for@@ ci@@ bly disp@@ lac@@ ed from their homes — 3@@ 2,000 people .
and she said to me , &quot; i have no future .
i believe how we treat the u@@ pr@@ oo@@ ted will shape the future of our world .
he never lost consciousness . rather , he watched from within as his body shu@@ t down , lim@@ b by lim@@ b , muscle by muscle .
his bed@@ side became a site for those see@@ king advice and spiritu@@ al coun@@ sel , and through us , my father was able to speak and up@@ lift , letter by letter , blin@@ k by blin@@ k .
as he began to re@@ gain his ability to brea@@ the , i started recor@@ ding his thoughts , and so the voice that you hear in this video is his voice .
as he says , &quot; i &apos;m living in a broken world , and there is ho@@ ly work to do . &quot;
we &apos;re constantly bom@@ bar@@ ded with stories about how much data there is in the world , but when it comes to big data and the challenges of interpre@@ ting it , size isn &apos;t everything .
but i actually think there &apos;s a bit of acci@@ den@@ tal wisdom in what he said , because facts are stu@@ b@@ born things , but sometimes they &apos;re stupid , too .
i &apos;m a big fan of being pre@@ gn@@ ant near free@@ ways , personally .
what we have to do is treat critical thinking with respect and be inspired by examples like the health media col@@ laboratory ,
ini@@ tially , this too was amazing : growing economy , ex@@ cell@@ ent infrastructure , and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in africa .
the sen@@ ate comes and says , &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ u@@ h ,
the first thing they need to do is they need to create pros@@ per@@ ity for the continent .
they need to build these institutions such that we are never held to r@@ ans@@ om again by a few individuals like robert mu@@ gab@@ e .
but what we &apos;re doing is just one group of institutions .
and it &apos;s only now , with more evidence and new technology that it &apos;s possible to make this a model for deliver@@ ing aid .
what if , instead , we use technology to put cas@@ h , whether from aid agen@@ cies or from any one of us directly into a poor person &apos;s hands .
of course , giving cas@@ h won &apos;t create public goods like era@@ dic@@ ating disease or building strong institutions ,
but until we can go there , i think the oceans still hold quite a few secre@@ ts .
so mission 31 wasn &apos;t so much about breaking records . it was about that human@@ -@@ ocean connection .
and that particular camera gives us an insight into what fairly common animals do but we can &apos;t even see it in the blin@@ k of an eye .
we need to dream , we need to be creative , and we all need to have an ad@@ venture in order to create mi@@ rac@@ les in the dar@@ ke@@ st of times .

every morning , her father would wake up in the hop@@ es he &apos;d be picked for construction work ,
now , since i &apos;ve been in afghanistan and since i &apos;ve been an at@@ tor@@ ney for over 10 years , i &apos;ve represen@@ ted from ce@@ os of fortun@@ e 500 companies to am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors to little girls like na@@ gh@@ ma , and with much success .
now , with my job , there &apos;s abo@@ ve-@@ average amount of risks that are involved .
prote@@ cting journali@@ sts and our right to recei@@ ve information prote@@ c@@ ts us .
and when she went there , instead of prote@@ cting her , they dra@@ gged her back to her husband &apos;s house , and she was tor@@ tured even worse .
i wanted to see what a crazy person looked like . &quot; the laws are ours , and no matter what your eth@@ ni@@ city , nation@@ ality , gender , race ,
usually photograph@@ ing things like the sp@@ hin@@ x , the py@@ rami@@ ds — who happened to be right around the corner , and they fle@@ w a camera and they took some sn@@ ap@@ sho@@ ts ,
just yesterday , i was attac@@ ked by a guy who cla@@ im@@ ed that i was fil@@ ming him .
now , i can tell you that it &apos;s easy a lot , but i think a really good way to prove that is to gra@@ b a second one and la@@ unch it .
and then five days later , i received the news that i had breast cancer .
now , these are gol@@ den words coming from someone who is speaking about their own experience , but when someone is telling you how you are going to feel , it &apos;s inst@@ ant cra@@ p .
he lived by himself , he would come in for che@@ mo@@ therapy by himself , he would recei@@ ve his treatment , and then he &apos;d walk home alone .

and this reflec@@ ts the extraordinary strength of the emerging indian middle class and the power that their mobile phones bring .
so hen@@ ry ti@@ m@@ ms and i — hen@@ ry &apos;s a fellow movement buil@@ der — got talking one day and we started to think , how can we make sense of this new world ?
i as@@ sure you that his facebook page has not embr@@ ac@@ ed the power of particip@@ ation . new power is not inher@@ ently positive .
new power values of inform@@ al , net@@ worked govern@@ ance .
well , if you &apos;re there thinking , in old power , this won &apos;t happen to us . then just look at the wikipedia en@@ try for en@@ cycl@@ op@@ æ@@ dia brit@@ an@@ ni@@ ca .
and the challenge for u@@ ber — this isn &apos;t an easy situation for them — is that they are loc@@ ked into a bro@@ a@@ der super@@ str@@ cu@@ ture that is really old power .

there are clean energy subsi@@ dies , which are to switch to fu@@ els which don &apos;t pollu@@ te as much or perhaps don &apos;t need fossil fu@@ els .
but we also need to consider the fact that although these high pri@@ ces seem unusual for antibio@@ tics , they &apos;re nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs , which might save a patient &apos;s life only for a few months or perhaps a year , whereas antibio@@ tics would potentially save a patient &apos;s life forever .

imagine if businesses compe@@ ted not just on the basis of their economic contribu@@ tion , but on their contribu@@ tion to social progress .
and when this highly un@@ productive se@@ ssion is over , you go back to your des@@ k ,
our goal today is to come to an agre@@ ement on a very important pro@@ pos@@ al .
these are real quo@@ tes and it &apos;s real sad .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and the top result was &quot; dem@@ ons . &quot;
it can be that people don &apos;t want to associ@@ ate with anyone who won &apos;t or can &apos;t fit themselves into a box that &apos;s la@@ bel@@ ed normal .

six months later , in mar@@ ch , he called my husband and me , and he said , &quot; oh , mom and dad , we have a doctor that found a diagnos@@ is for that w@@ ri@@ st .
and i &apos;m going to get it in front of phil@@ anthrop@@ ists like bill gates . &quot;
it was in a pha@@ se i@@ ii trial .
i &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s one of the best ones , and that was probably in day two .
and the als patients ,
the first thing is , every morning when you wake up , you can choose to live your day in posi@@ tivity .
that gir@@ l@@ friend that he went to get on the night of diagnos@@ is is now his wife ,
which are actually materials that will work with the body , helping it to he@@ al and helping it to allow the w@@ ounds to he@@ al normally .
so that means if you put it onto li@@ ver , it turns into something that looks like li@@ ver ,
you see , i &apos;ve been thinking about this a lot .
now , gaz@@ a , syri@@ a , su@@ dan , u@@ kra@@ ine ,
today it &apos;s one in two , and tomorrow vir@@ tually everyone is going to be there .
now , if you look at mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u for example , in mo@@ ga@@ di@@ sh@@ u the mean age is 16 years old .
we &apos;ve heard extraordinary activi@@ ties of civil society groups who are enga@@ ging in local and global collective action , and this is leading to digital prote@@ st and real revolution .
there &apos;s wonderful work that &apos;s happening that i &apos;ve been involved with in king@@ ston , j@@ ama@@ ica and right here in rio , which is putting education , emplo@@ y@@ ment , re@@ creation up front for these high-@@ risk groups ,
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 2@@ 14@@ 1 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
the fact is that these people can sometimes , sometimes , sometimes cure things we cannot .
this fellow looked at the medicine man , and he said , &quot; you didn &apos;t go to medical school , did you ? &quot;
bottom half carbon in the atmosphere where it &apos;s driving climate change .
and they have lots of lessons to teach us .
every time a sha@@ man dies , it &apos;s as if a library has bur@@ ned down .
moving down to these two national par@@ ks , ca@@ hu@@ in@@ ari and pur@@ é in the col@@ om@@ bi@@ an amazon — that &apos;s the brazili@@ an bor@@ der to the right — it &apos;s home to several groups of isol@@ ated and un@@ contac@@ ted peop@@ les .
what &apos;s to be done ?
thanks again .
&#91; &quot; fil@@ med with hidden cameras &quot; &#93; man : we are now going to speak about the up@@ coming elec@@ tions .
and had to spend time in ja@@ il .
the guy in green is palest@@ ini@@ an .
the second thing i learned is that we have to en@@ able them to film in a safe way .
to have an effect , the key thing is how you use the material .
and now , as i sit in my seat i only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day , my dreams , my children at school ,
and while we weren &apos;t sequ@@ encing genom@@ es or building space teles@@ cop@@ es , this is a story about giving everything we had to achieve something that hadn &apos;t been done before .
dro@@ pping multiple , pre-@@ posi@@ tioned de@@ po@@ ts of food and fuel through which scott &apos;s final team of five would travel to the pole , where they would turn around and sk@@ i back to the coast again on foot .
we didn &apos;t see a sun@@ set either .
i think it &apos;s a mar@@ vel@@ ous thing that humans can exist 3@@ 65 days of the year with ha@@ mb@@ ur@@ gers and hot sho@@ wers and movie the@@ at@@ ers , but it does seem to produce a lot of empty car@@ d@@ board box@@ es .
and then we ran out of food completely ,
one of sh@@ ac@@ kle@@ ton &apos;s men described cros@@ sing this sort of ter@@ rain as like walking over the glass roof of a ra@@ il@@ way station .
right now , i am very happy just rec@@ over@@ ing and in front of hotel bu@@ ffe@@ ts .
now , what about labor demand ?
now , to tell the truth , in reality , the situation will be even more challen@@ ging .
and it will grow to more than 50 percent by 20@@ 30 .
and the top choice worldwide is the u.@@ s .
work@@ force planning will become more important than financial planning .
now , to be clear , north american z@@ oos are st@@ aff@@ ed by highly qu@@ ali@@ fied , bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans who take out@@ standing care of their animal patients .
i feel that tu@@ g of human excep@@ tion@@ alism , even as i recognize the scienti@@ fic@@ ally isol@@ ating cost of seeing ourselves as a super@@ ior species , apart .
but veter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans have de@@ vis@@ ed an interven@@ tion to deal with this fo@@ al re@@ jec@@ tion syn@@ dro@@ me
&lt; / doc &gt;
it gives me time to speak with each person and to look at them , in silence , while they look back at me .
not the way we look , but the way we are .
&lt; speaker &gt; thomas hel@@ lu@@ m &lt; / speaker &gt;
wow . brilliant idea , except
and another funny thing :
and n@@ r@@ k rol@@ led all its equipment on board a ship , and 200 meters out of the sh@@ ore , trans@@ mit@@ ting the signal back ,
and with some very creative solutions .
you can see the famous tro@@ l@@ l@@ f@@ jor@@ d and a day after , all-@@ time high for n@@ r@@ k@@ 2 .
in fact , nothing coun@@ ts , and death is coming for us all . th : exactly . so why does this stand out ?
when people smile , it might be a very good slow idea ,
but more than that , increasingly , local police depart@@ ments are keeping records not just of people wanted for w@@ ron@@ g@@ doing , but of every plate that pas@@ ses them by ,
history has shown that once the police have massive qu@@ anti@@ ties of data , tracking the movements of inno@@ cent people , it gets abu@@ sed , maybe for blac@@ k@@ mail , maybe for political advantage , or maybe for simple vo@@ y@@ eu@@ ris@@ m .
under arm@@ our , you may have heard of , is a bal@@ ti@@ more company ,
it &apos;s something that we choose to do , and we could choose not to do it ,
or one even@@ ing when electricity had failed for eight hours in our community ,
i was going to do something , anything , to stop it .
we had no idea a big op@@ position was coming to us .
and they &apos;d be like , &quot; our hus@@ b@@ ands beat us . &quot;
because they can do it and we can &apos;t .
which would be an easy place for them to give train@@ ings , use it as a farm@@ er school , even as a marke@@ t@@ place , and anything they want to use it for ,
kb : do people here believe that i &apos;m at an age where i &apos;m supposed to be a grandmother in my village ?
kb : definitely . we are looking for as many people as we can , because now that the foundation &apos;s in the beginning process ,
i &apos;d like to think that &apos;s why mathema@@ ti@@ cians don &apos;t really bo@@ ther going on ni@@ ghts out anymore .
nobody thinks that she &apos;s ug@@ ly , but she &apos;s not a super@@ model , either .
so let &apos;s imagine then that you &apos;re a ro@@ aring success on the dat@@ ing scene .
but then imagine , the next person to come along is just mar@@ gin@@ ally less bor@@ ing , du@@ ll and terrible than everybody that you &apos;ve seen before .
but what go@@ tt@@ man and his team found was that one of the most important pre@@ di@@ ctors for whether or not a couple is going to get di@@ vor@@ ced was how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation .
but i hope that a@@ side from their use as ti@@ ps , they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics .
so in the following week , i was back in the streets , but that time , i wasn &apos;t a member of any media out@@ let anymore .
but then something happened , something that wasn &apos;t predic@@ ted , that no one could have anti@@ cip@@ ated .
we are not compe@@ ting for news .
but there &apos;s something more significant here , something that i believe is more important and more cruci@@ al than my personal example .
they said things like , &quot; i love a challenge , &quot; or , &quot; you know , i was hop@@ ing this would be informa@@ tive . &quot;
their biggest goal is getting the next a or the next test score ?
and they &apos;ve done so poor@@ ly for so long that many people think it &apos;s inevit@@ able .
mun@@ dan@@ o : p@@ im@@ p my ... tra@@ sh car@@ t ?
. so p@@ im@@ p my car@@ ro@@ ç@@ a is a large crow@@ d@@ fun@@ ded event to help cat@@ ad@@ or@@ es and their car@@ ro@@ ç@@ as .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : in this fun , short talk from ted@@ you@@ th , le@@ xic@@ o@@ grapher erin mc@@ ke@@ an encoura@@ ges — na@@ y , ch@@ eer@@ leads — her audience to create new words when the existing ones won ’ t quite do . she li@@ sts out 6 ways to make new words in english , from comp@@ ounding to “ verb@@ ing , ” in order to make language better at ex@@ pre@@ ssing what we mean , and to create more ways for us to understand one another .
so we &apos;ve been talking about this for a long time .
we usually take words for things that we like , like del@@ ici@@ ous food .
and of course , you can &quot; green &quot; things .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and you know , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly he &apos;s wearing ma@@ ke@@ up , the ligh@@ ting here is kind of challen@@ ging , but still , just from the video , we &apos;re able to extr@@ act his pul@@ se and show it quite well .
it &apos;s very simple to use .
but it turns out that sound also produc@@ es visual mo@@ tions .
and just to give you a sense of the scale of the mo@@ tions here , a pretty l@@ oud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micro@@ meter .
this is our team .
so let &apos;s talk about why saving wh@@ ales is critical to the resi@@ li@@ ency of the oceans .
thank you .
and therefore , i decided to dedic@@ ate my life to bringing down the walls that separate people .
this is not a photo pro@@ file for your facebook .
i just remember a feeling of surprise ; surprise at finding a street with no cars , as op@@ posed to the ne@@ ar@@ by mass . a@@ ve@@ . full of cars ;
einstein once said , &quot; lo@@ gic will get you from a to b .
walk the path through the park , not through the car park , and you have an entirely different path .
that you &apos;re really close to the beach .
and create another system . breaking the lo@@ gic of language also brea@@ ks the lo@@ gic of the system under which they &apos;ve learned to respond .
not only did they write a book , but they also b@@ ound it themselves .
ri@@ des on stor@@ ms that spread fire , lif@@ ts ch@@ est@@ s lo@@ wer@@ ed by shame , knows that it &apos;s not just reading and going on , it also wis@@ h@@ es to see the infin@@ ite blue .
and then we have about 40@@ ,000 others , the missing , the ones we &apos;re still looking for today .
most of these cri@@ mes happened 32 years ago .
and he was cap@@ tured on febru@@ ary 23 , 198@@ 4 .
but the bodies -- face down , most of them , hands ti@@ ed behind their bac@@ ks , blin@@ d@@ fol@@ ded , all types of trau@@ ma -- these were people who were defen@@ sel@@ ess who were being execu@@ ted .
&lt; / doc &gt;
it began for me at the age of 11 .
it was desper@@ ately cold again .
that took eight years , and i &apos;m so proud of it because we recyc@@ led all of it back here in south america .
it won &apos;t make financial sense ,
&quot; if you can do , or dream you can , begin it now ,
if we had to bo@@ il water to get the same effect as ev@@ ap@@ o@@ tran@@ spi@@ ration , we would need six months of the entire power generation capacity of the world .
so at this moment -- this is 2003 , 2004 -- i happened to be coming to work in the government .
so in the last 10 years , de@@ forest@@ ation came down in brazil 75 percent .
what we see here , those brown trees , these are really dead trees .
now we need to go down to 10 by 2050 .
thank you .
today we made a big step forward . &quot;
they don &apos;t speak the same language .
then , of course , there &apos;s the struggle for life , the survival of the fit@@ test , social dar@@ win@@ ism .
so some psycholo@@ gists said , when i tell them i run 1@@ 40 human@@ itarian projects in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as that give me so much joy , they said , &quot; oh , i see , you work for the warm g@@ low .
two thousand years of con@@ temp@@ la@@ tive study said yes , it is .
so now where do we go from there ?
sustainable harmon@@ y means now we will reduce ine@@ quality .
crow@@ ds of men with be@@ ards and sk@@ ul@@ l@@ cap@@ s were s@@ warming the streets .
for those that don &apos;t know , hal@@ al is a term used for meat that is raised and sla@@ ugh@@ tered human@@ ely following very stri@@ ct islam@@ ic gu@@ i@@ del@@ ines .
sara@@ h ber@@ g@@ bre@@ it@@ er : why i make robots the size of a gra@@ in of ri@@ ce
that &apos;s almost 100 times its own l@@ ength .
so this is a micro-@@ fabri@@ c@@ ated ener@@ ge@@ tic material ,
&lt; speaker &gt; mor@@ gan@@ a ba@@ i@@ ley &lt; / speaker &gt;
every time i would think about coming out in the past , i would think to myself , but i just want to be known as mor@@ gan@@ a , uni@@ qu@@ ely mor@@ gan@@ a , but not &quot; my les@@ bi@@ an friend mor@@ gan@@ a , &quot; or &quot; my gay co@@ wor@@ ker mor@@ gan@@ a . &quot;
how does her father feel ?
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
so that is a pi@@ ti@@ able state of af@@ fa@@ irs .
san@@ itation is more about dig@@ n@@ ity than about human disp@@ os@@ al of waste .
before we started , there were , as usual , more than 80 percent of people suffering from water@@ bor@@ ne diseases .
sever@@ ine au@@ te@@ ss@@ er@@ re : to solve mass violence , look to loc@@ als
but today i want to tell you a different story .
throughout the world , and throughout conflict zones , this common culture shapes the interven@@ er &apos;s understanding of the causes of violence as something that is pri@@ mar@@ ily loc@@ ated in the national and international sp@@ her@@ es . it shapes our understanding of the path toward peace
for instance , the very identity of the united nations as this mac@@ ro@@ -@@ level diplom@@ ati@@ c organization would be u@@ pen@@ ded if it were to re@@ focus on local conflic@@ ts .
it &apos;s with programs like this that we can help people like is@@ ab@@ el@@ le and her husband .
and vo@@ il@@ a , that picture went vir@@ al and broke the cen@@ sor@@ ship and forced mass media to cover it .
and this rais@@ es a question : as digital technology makes things easier for movements , why haven &apos;t successful out@@ comes become more likely as well ?
they had to meet almost all the time to keep this car@@ pool going .
it &apos;s in that capacity to work together , think together collec@@ tively , which can only be built over time with a lot of work .
and politics and democracy without an effective challenge ho@@ bb@@ les , because the causes that have inspired the modern recent movements are cruci@@ al .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
the leaders listen@@ ed . they turned the tab@@ les .
m@@ s@@ f rapidly set up an ebola treatment center , as many of you know , in the area .
not only did this virus continue in the places where they &apos;d already become infected , but then it started to es@@ cal@@ ate and we saw the case numbers that you see here , something we &apos;d never seen before on such a scale , an exponenti@@ al increase of ebola cases not just in these countries or the areas already infected in these countries but also spre@@ ading further and deeper into these countries .
and then we &apos;ve got to be able to have systems that can find every single case , every contact of those cases , and begin to track the trans@@ mission cha@@ ins so that you can stop trans@@ mission .
what we saw , ladies and gentlemen , which was probably most im@@ pre@@ ssive , was this incredible work by the governments , by the leaders in these countries , with the communities , to try to en@@ sure people understood this disease , understood the extraordinary things they would have to do to try and stop ebola .
but it will only finish if those countries have got enough epide@@ mi@@ ologists , enough health workers , enough lo@@ gi@@ st@@ ici@@ ans and enough other people working with them to be able to find every one of those cases , track their cont@@ acts and make sure that this disease stop@@ s once and for all .
and women share the same distribution as well , but actually there &apos;s quite a big difference .
if you think they &apos;re fighting , you &apos;re a bit more of a na@@ sty , aggre@@ ssive person .
learning sty@@ les are made up and are not suppor@@ ted by scientific evidence .
which kind of makes sense because your brain contro@@ ls the opposite hands , so le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand@@ ed people , the right side of the brain is slightly more active than the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side of the brain ,
and in every single culture across the glo@@ be , men plac@@ ed more value on physical at@@ tr@@ acti@@ ven@@ ess in a partner than did women , and in every single culture , too , women plac@@ ed more importance than did men on ambi@@ tion and high ear@@ ning power . in every culture , too , men pre@@ fer@@ red women who were youn@@ ger than themselves , an average of , i think it was 2.@@ 6@@ 6 years ,
because although we all think we can catch a li@@ ar from their body language and speech patterns ,
and like many of these design exer@@ cis@@ es , it kind of seems tri@@ vi@@ al at first , but under deep in@@ spec@@ tion , it turns out that it reve@@ als un@@ expected tru@@ ths about the way that we collabor@@ ate and make sense of things .
so no@@ des represent the tan@@ gi@@ ble objects like the to@@ a@@ ster and people , and links represent the connections between the no@@ des .
and systems the@@ ori@@ sts do tell us that the ease with which we can change a represen@@ tation cor@@ rel@@ ates to our wil@@ ling@@ ness to improve the model .
and the practice is really pretty simple .
i &apos;m an artist and i cut books .
and with the material itself , i &apos;m using sand@@ paper
and it &apos;s very exciting to see what will happen with the book in the future .
and i think what they do can tell us a lot about drugs that we can develop for humans .
and the result , as so often in science , was bor@@ ing :
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 17@@ 5@@ 25@@ 25 &quot; &gt; ro@@ min@@ a po@@ l &lt; / reviewer &gt;
the moment his foot land@@ ed on the floor , i thought , why don &apos;t i put a pressure sens@@ or on the heel of his foot ?
which consu@@ mes very little power and can be driven by a co@@ in-@@ si@@ zed battery .
a beautiful mon@@ th-@@ old baby who was ad@@ mit@@ ted with signs of a sever@@ e resp@@ ir@@ atory infec@@ tion .
what do i mean by that ? is there any other effect beyond prote@@ cting ourselves ?
all these people dep@@ end almost exclu@@ si@@ vely on her@@ d im@@ m@@ unity to be protected against diseases .
it was fra@@ u@@ dul@@ ent .
at that time , we set out to understand what was happening .
&lt; / doc &gt;
and now these guys have also started saying that behind information security and credit cards are prime numbers .
all the basic sci@@ ences support them , including math .
and the world , as you know , spl@@ it into p@@ app@@ ists and anti-@@ p@@ app@@ ists , until 17@@ 00 years later when in 199@@ 9 , thomas hal@@ es pro@@ ved that p@@ app@@ us and the bees were right -- the best shape to use was the he@@ x@@ ag@@ on .
but if you want to tell them that you &apos;ll love them forever and ever , give them a the@@ or@@ em !
well , nothing .
i knew he would call in the morning , but that night was one of the sa@@ d@@ dest and l@@ onge@@ st ni@@ ghts of my life .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s so important that we pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze our psychological health , that we practice emotional hy@@ gi@@ ene .
and his eyes opened wide and he said , &quot; where have i seen your face before ? &quot; and i said , &quot; in the front seat . &quot;
and it &apos;s interesting that we do , because our self-@@ e@@ ste@@ em is already hur@@ ting .
but i knew what to do .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 2@@ 19@@ 5 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
in tu@@ ni@@ sia , i met as@@ ma , one of the four activist women i intervie@@ wed .

so doing this mission , i really started thinking more deeply about our future in ou@@ ter space .
this was the last version that was just presen@@ ted a few weeks ago in hol@@ land ,
&lt; translator href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 28@@ 0@@ 6@@ 20 &quot; &gt; gis@@ ela gi@@ ar@@ din@@ o &lt; / translator &gt;
she didn &apos;t give me a response , and what she said was this : she said , &quot; why don &apos;t you leave your number , and if we have some open@@ ings , i &apos;ll give you a call ? &quot;
so , what i did -- and he said , &quot; you shouldn &apos;t worry , jim , because there are a lot of tra@@ il@@ er par@@ ks . &quot;
and we saw one , it was a great big , bright fla@@ shing light that said , &quot; vac@@ an@@ cies , vac@@ an@@ cies , vac@@ an@@ ies . &quot; so we stopped in .
i jump@@ ed on a plane and shot off to go@@ ose bay , la@@ bra@@ d@@ or , which is another story , right ?
you need to ask them for their identific@@ ation . &apos; &quot; and here &apos;s what the boys have been taught to tell them : &quot; we know that you can do that , but please do not do that while we &apos;re in the car because the consequences for you are signific@@ antly different than the consequences for us . &quot;
these are the statistics of our infrastructure .
this is a form you can find on the tax@@ i and lim@@ ous@@ ine com@@ mission website .
in fact , hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of p@@ d@@ f put out by our very own n@@ yp@@ d ,
but once again , it wasn &apos;t super easy ,
this is the google street view car driving by finding the same parking tic@@ ket . so i wrote about this on my blog , on i qu@@ ant ny , and the do@@ t respon@@ ded , and they said , &quot; while the do@@ t has not received any comp@@ la@@ in@@ ts about this location , we will revie@@ w the ro@@ ad@@ way mark@@ ings and make any appropriate al@@ ter@@ ations . &quot;

two : believe someone else has the answers for you .
or , &quot; i can &apos;t find good talent ; my team is so below expect@@ ations . &quot;
and your journey is simple -- it &apos;s made of steps .
well , it turns out that we do have something just like that : our gu@@ t , or rather , its microbes .
and so when we do that with the human microbi@@ ome data from 250 healthy volunte@@ ers , it looks like this .
so whi@@ ch@@ ever way we look at it , we &apos;re vast@@ ly out@@ nu@@ mber@@ ed by our microbi@@ al sym@@ bi@@ on@@ ts .
now , for the first time , you &apos;re going to see one of my collea@@ gue &apos;s children develop microbi@@ ally .
they may also be de@@ gra@@ ding our gu@@ t microbi@@ al ecosyste@@ ms ,
this is truly amazing because it suggests that we can pil@@ ot therap@@ ies by trying them out in a whole bunch of different m@@ ice with individual people &apos;s gu@@ t communities
so one day after you do that transp@@ l@@ ant , all those symp@@ tom@@ s clear up , the di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a van@@ ish@@ es , and they &apos;re essentially healthy again , coming to rese@@ mble the don@@ or &apos;s community , and they stay there .
they tend to con@@ so@@ li@@ date in the hands of the few , and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many .
how do they stay competi@@ tive ?
in the summer of 2011 , as a tou@@ ri@@ st , i vis@@ ited the rain@@ forests of bor@@ ne@@ o for the very first time ,
there was cell phone service way out in the middle of no@@ where .
but in fact , cell phones are great .
that guy &apos;s much bra@@ ver than i am .
tw@@ en@@ ty-@@ five years ago , scientists at cer@@ n created the world wide web .
before the invention of email , we lar@@ gely communic@@ ated using letters ,
and to optimi@@ ze the ads that are shown to us , companies have to know everything about us .
well , it &apos;s probably a good idea not to put the keys on the ser@@ ver .
and i think the answer is actually yes ,
this really matters , because ultimately , privacy depends on each and every one of us , and we have to protect it now because our online data is more than just a collection of ones and zer@@ os .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of everything is cra@@ p , so there &apos;s this to prove that stur@@ geon was correct .
it starts with a de@@ ck of cards onto the table , an old man and a claim , &quot; i will not touch the de@@ ck ti@@ ll the end . &quot;
did you feel i influ@@ enced you in any decision ?
i believe that amazing things happen all the time .
is that fair ?
because maybe , maybe they mean a lot .

these are all 2@@ d printing technologies .
so we can see how the process works .
these look like injec@@ tion@@ -@@ mol@@ ded parts , which is very different than traditional 3d manufacturing .
we &apos;re really good at that , but it &apos;s actually very hard to make things from 10 mic@@ r@@ ons to 1,000 mic@@ r@@ ons , the me@@ s@@ os@@ c@@ ale .
almost 40 rap son@@ gs . but the night of my speech , a surprising thing happened .
i was patient zero of losing a personal repu@@ tation on a global scale almost instan@@ tan@@ e@@ ously .
sc@@ ared and mor@@ ti@@ fied , i listen , listen as i pr@@ at@@ tle on about the flo@@ t@@ sa@@ m and j@@ et@@ sa@@ m of the day ; listen as i conf@@ ess my love for the president , and , of course , my he@@ art@@ break ;
it served to re@@ con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alize my experiences , and i then began to look at the world of hu@@ mili@@ ation and bul@@ lying around me and see something different .
the docu@@ ments which received the most attention were private e@@ ma@@ ils that had maxim@@ um public embar@@ ra@@ ss@@ ment value .
and it &apos;s time for an interven@@ tion on the internet and in our culture .
you can read between the lines in those questions , and the answer has nothing to do with politics .
our society is more technolo@@ g@@ ically advanced than ever .
it &apos;s part of the general field of artificial intelligence .
so by age three , a child would have seen hundreds of millions of pictures of the real world .
now that we have the data to n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh our computer brain , we &apos;re ready to come back to the algorithms themselves .
soon , another develop@@ mental mi@@ le@@ stone will be hit , and children begin to communicate in senten@@ ces .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : ten days after 9 / 11 , a sho@@ cking attack at a texas mini@@ -@@ mar@@ t sh@@ at@@ tered the lives of two men : the vic@@ tim and the attac@@ ker . in this stun@@ ning talk , an@@ and gi@@ ri@@ d@@ har@@ a@@ da@@ s , auth@@ or of &quot; the true american , &quot; tells the story of what happened next . it &apos;s a par@@ able about the two pa@@ ths an american life can take , and a powerful call for re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
he rec@@ ites vers@@ es from the koran , beg@@ ging his god to live .
his right eye couldn &apos;t see .
his mother told him , re@@ gre@@ t@@ fully , as a boy that she &apos;d been just 50 dollars short of abor@@ ting him .
and how would he interven@@ e ?
i never h@@ ated you . &quot;
if any or all of these things describe you , then accept the possibility that actually , you may not know what &apos;s going on and you may be part of the problem . other generations had to build a fresh society after sla@@ very , pull through a depression , de@@ fe@@ at fas@@ c@@ ism , fre@@ ed@@ om@@ -@@ ride in mis@@ si@@ ssi@@ pp@@ i .
the@@ a@@ ster gates : how to re@@ vi@@ ve a neighborhood : with imagination , beauty and art
it is not a g@@ ated community by far .
so we were not only thinking about development , but we were thinking about the program , thinking about the kind of connections that could happen between one house and another , between one neigh@@ bor and another .
and so now that the ru@@ mor of my block has spread , and lots of people are starting to visit , we &apos;ve found that the bank can now be a center for exhi@@ bi@@ tion , archi@@ ves , music performance , and that there are people who are now interested in being ad@@ jac@@ ent to those buildings because we brought some heat , that we kind of made a fire .
the@@ a@@ ster gates : one of the things i &apos;ve found that &apos;s really important is giving thought to not just the kind of individual project , like an old house , but what &apos;s the relationship between an old house , a local school , a small bo@@ de@@ ga , and is there some kind of sy@@ ner@@ gy between those things ?
so how do you start to grow up important wat@@ ch@@ dogs that en@@ sure that the resources that are made available to new fol@@ k that are coming in are also distribu@@ ted to fol@@ k who have lived in a place for a long time .
in my childhood , they taught me silence .
i saw the kill@@ ings . i saw the disp@@ lac@@ ement .
it was a story to them .
what &apos;s happening now with pa@@ wa ?
he told me that one night in 196@@ 9 , a group of young black and lat@@ ino drag que@@ ens f@@ ought back against the police at a gay bar in manhattan called the st@@ on@@ e@@ wall in@@ n , and how this spar@@ ked the modern gay rights movement .
so in grand central ter@@ min@@ al 11 years ago , we built a boo@@ th where anyone can come to honor someone else by intervie@@ wing them about their life .
j@@ l : what &apos;s co@@ lic ? s@@ l : it &apos;s when you get this stom@@ ach ach@@ e and all you do is scre@@ am for , like , four hours .
i think it &apos;s because you &apos;re hearing something auth@@ enti@@ c and pure at this moment , when sometimes it &apos;s hard to tell what &apos;s real and what &apos;s an adver@@ ti@@ se@@ ment .
you write a love letter to me every morning .
hopefully one day , i &apos;ll be able to experience that with you .
i &apos;m going to tell you a secret about story@@ cor@@ ps .
that &apos;s the easy part , the technology .
and maybe in doing so , we &apos;ll learn to listen a little more and sh@@ out a little less .
but i &apos;ve done more in the seven decades since that mis@@ er@@ able day when my mother put me on the train than i would ever have dre@@ am@@ ed possible .
so i had to com@@ promise with oper@@ ational research work , which had the intellectual challenge that interested me and the commercial value that was valu@@ ed by the cli@@ ents : things like sche@@ du@@ ling fre@@ ight tra@@ ins , ti@@ me-@@ tab@@ ling bu@@ ses , stock control , lots and lots of stock control .
if success were easy , we &apos;d all be milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res .
and that made me able to cope with change , indeed , eventually to wel@@ come change , though i &apos;m told i &apos;m still very difficult .
they understood that ignor@@ ance and fear were but matters of the mind ,
but i was not raised to think of myself as in any way remarkable .
sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . you do not know the power of the dark side .
when blind people learn to see , si@@ gh@@ ted people seem inspired to want to learn to see their way better , more clearly , with less fear , because this ex@@ emp@@ li@@ fi@@ es the im@@ men@@ se capacity within us all to navi@@ gate any type of challenge , through any form of dar@@ kness , to discover@@ ies uni@@ mag@@ ined when we are activ@@ ated .
&lt; / doc &gt;
now , m@@ é@@ dec@@ ins s@@ ans fron@@ ti@@ è@@ res did a great job or@@ che@@ str@@ ating volunte@@ ers .
and that was just lu@@ ck .
so they are absolutely ready to go .
thank you .
so if china does become the world &apos;s largest economy , think about this : it &apos;ll be the first time since this guy was on the thr@@ one of england -- george i@@ ii , not a good friend of n@@ ap@@ o@@ le@@ on &apos;s -- that in the world we will have as the largest economy a non-@@ english speaking country , a non-@@ western country , a non-@@ liber@@ al democratic country .
and she said , &quot; understand this , learn this , because it &apos;s going to affect your future . &quot;
history is against us when it comes to the u.s. and china for@@ ging a common future together .
number one : china feels as if it &apos;s been hu@@ mili@@ ated at the hands of the west through a hundred years of history ,
the challenge , though , is given those deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted feelings , those deep@@ -@@ roo@@ ted emotions and thought patterns , what the chinese call &quot; s@@ ī@@ w@@ é@@ i , &quot; ways of thinking , how can we craft a basis for a common future between these two ?
and they walked into this caf@@ e qu@@ ie@@ tly , ten@@ t@@ ati@@ vely , g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly , a little an@@ xi@@ ous .
you can make a practical contribu@@ tion ,
i wanted the ro@@ cket .
and this was great , and i saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction to this than the things that i had made in rec@@ t@@ ang@@ les .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is not a view into the world , it &apos;s basically the whole world stre@@ t@@ ched into a rec@@ t@@ angle .
and we showed it to a group of people whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people .
the problem is that we have these color@@ -@@ tin@@ ted gla@@ sses as we look at all kinds of situations .
imagine i took all the people in the u.s. and i sor@@ ted them from the poor@@ est on the right to the rich@@ est on the left , and then i divi@@ ded them into five bu@@ ckets : the poor@@ est 20 percent , the next 20 percent , the next , the next , and the rich@@ est 20 percent .
he said a just society is a society that if you knew everything about it , you would be willing to enter it in a random place .
i know some of you went to harvard business school .
how do we get people to think differently about ine@@ quality and the consequences of ine@@ quality in terms of health , education , je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , crime rate , and so on ?
my parents also f@@ led to pakistan , and sett@@ led in que@@ tta , where i was born .
the attacks on the ha@@ z@@ ar@@ a community would only get worse ,
sha@@ b@@ bi@@ r and na@@ wro@@ z were never seen again .
we have to turn back the boat .
i also decided to stay in in@@ don@@ e@@ sia and process my case through un@@ h@@ c@@ r , but i was really afraid that i would end up in in@@ don@@ e@@ sia for many years doing nothing and un@@ able to work , like every other as@@ y@@ lu@@ m see@@ ker .
i said , &quot; it &apos;s impossible . &quot;
when you put many children in a qui@@ et box , some of them get really nervous .
this is how they divi@@ de class@@ rooms .
and in this kind of occa@@ sion , they learn to help each other .
when i was 11 , seeing some of my friends leaving the school because their parents could not afford tex@@ t@@ books
these are the people -- forget about allo@@ wing them to go to the temp@@ les , they cannot even go into the houses and shop@@ s of high-@@ ca@@ ste people .
i went to another leader and his wife told me , &quot; okay , you go , he will definitely join . &quot;
and after that , i should organi@@ ze a f@@ east for pri@@ est@@ s , 10@@ 1 pri@@ est@@ s , wa@@ sh their feet and drink that water .
i thought that if i keep on free@@ ing 10 children , and 50 more will join , that &apos;s not done .
an@@ ger is within each one of you ,
and over that time , i &apos;ve seen a lot of crazy things in the markets , and i &apos;ve tra@@ ded a lot of crazy mani@@ as .
yes , that &apos;s us , with the greatest income ine@@ quality and the greatest social problems , according to those me@@ tric@@ s .
we &apos;re but me@@ ssen@@ gers , but we have 100 percent confidence and faith in the american public to get it right .
well , you know , sometimes
beyond this horizon we don &apos;t know where we are coming from .
well , actually , it is .
everything you see in this picture is a living organis@@ m .
cele@@ sti@@ al mechan@@ ics is not making it so easy for an exchange of material between planets ,
they were scre@@ aming with la@@ ughter .
so what i &apos;m doing now is you see something much more like this .
you can catch la@@ ughter from somebody else , and you are more likely to catch la@@ ughter off somebody else if you know them .
chimpan@@ ze@@ es lau@@ gh differently if they &apos;re being tic@@ kle@@ d than if they &apos;re playing with each other ,
and i think what that means is , even if you &apos;re having your brain scan@@ ned , which is completely bor@@ ing and not very interesting , when you hear somebody going , &quot; a ha ha ha ha ha , &quot; you &apos;re trying to work out why they &apos;re laugh@@ ing .
there &apos;s a really lo@@ vely set of studies coming out from robert leven@@ son &apos;s lab in california , where he &apos;s doing a lon@@ g@@ itu@@ din@@ al study with cou@@ ples .
and now they &apos;re all off .
&lt; speaker &gt; je@@ di@@ da@@ h is@@ ler &lt; / speaker &gt;
clear answers to this question were almost completely in@@ ac@@ ces@@ sible until 2008 , when nasa launched a new telescope that better detec@@ ts gam@@ ma ray light -- that is , light with ener@@ gies a million times higher than your standard x-@@ ray scan .
unfortunately , all his spin@@ os@@ aur@@ us b@@ ones were destro@@ yed in world war ii .
again , this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water , it &apos;s useful for bu@@ o@@ y@@ an@@ cy control in the water .
the things i had to see , and feel and touch were pretty un@@ spea@@ k@@ able . what i can tell you is this : that the r@@ wand@@ an genocide was one of the world &apos;s greatest fail@@ u@@ res of simple compassion .
thir@@ ty-@@ five years ago , when i would have been gradu@@ ating from high school , they told us that 40@@ ,000 kids every day died because of poverty .
those two forms of violence account for more death and dis@@ ability than malaria , than car acci@@ dents , than war combin@@ ed .
listen . disp@@ at@@ ch@@ er : i don &apos;t have anybody to send out there .
so you would think that the di@@ sin@@ te@@ gra@@ tion of basic law en@@ for@@ cement in the developing world would be a huge pri@@ ority for the global fight against poverty .
violence can be stopped .
there &apos;s a political will struggle that &apos;s going to take place as well , but those are win@@ n@@ able fi@@ ghts , because we &apos;ve done some examples around the world at international justice mission that are very encoura@@ ging .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : as kids , we all get advice from parents and teachers that seems strange , even confu@@ sing . this was cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zed one night for a young clin@@ t smith , who was playing with water gun@@ s in a dark parking lot with his white friends . in a he@@ art@@ felt piece , the po@@ et pain@@ ts the scene of his father &apos;s fu@@ ri@@ ous and fe@@ ar@@ ful response .

we know that complicated mechanis@@ ms take a long time to evol@@ ve .
a biological neuron fi@@ res , maybe , at 200 her@@ tz , 200 times a second .
all of this super@@ intelligence could develop , and possibly quite rapidly .
he tou@@ ches his food , it turns into gold .
now , i &apos;m actually fairly optimi@@ stic that this problem can be solved .

have you ever heard what your brain sounds like ?

today i want to talk about the second institu@@ tion over@@ seeing the journey from childhood to adul@@ th@@ ood in the united states .
young people worried that at any moment , they will be stopped , search@@ ed and sei@@ zed .
sometimes children would simply give up running ,
that winter , a kid in the school@@ y@@ ard called chu@@ ck &apos;s mom a cr@@ ack wh@@ ore .
and then a ju@@ ven@@ ile ju@@ dge , a few days later , char@@ ged tim , age 11 , and then he was plac@@ ed on three years of prob@@ ation .
we tend to think about justice in a pretty nar@@ row way : good and bad , inno@@ cent and gu@@ il@@ ty .
texas has gotten into the game now , also clos@@ ing pri@@ sons , inve@@ sting in education .
her plan was to row it alone across the atlan@@ tic ocean --

the waves
but now i &apos;m so heavy , nothing con@@ so@@ les me .
until last year , i &apos;d never kept bees before , but national geo@@ graphic asked me to photograph a story about them ,
in the long run , that &apos;s bad news ,
thank you .
will i see my family or die alone ?
in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated 29 years .
this is not my home .
the living room over@@ looks the valley from the fourth floor .
try getting that truck down the mountain .
it looks a lot like a kitchen , right ?
and what it says is : respect it , design for its str@@ eng@@ ths , protect it from water , and to make the most of its cur@@ ves .
this floor is made of g@@ los@@ sy and du@@ ra@@ ble bam@@ bo@@ o skin .
it is beautiful , gold standard . love it .
the flag should be so simple that a child can draw it from memory .
w@@ het mos@@ er : like , there &apos;s probably at least one store on every block near where i work that sel@@ ls some sort of chicago flag par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ali@@ a .
t@@ k : it &apos;s a relatively complex flag .
but sometimes it isn &apos;t , all right ?
and because it &apos;s so ba@@ da@@ ss , those fla@@ gs and cros@@ ses are found throughout am@@ ster@@ dam ,
s@@ k : i believe mil@@ wa@@ u@@ ke@@ e is a great city . every great city deser@@ ves a great flag .
this one &apos;s by ne@@ il mu@@ s@@ se@@ tt .
but a great city flag is something that represents a city to its people and its people to the world at large .
they &apos;re legal things .
in 2000 , the indian su@@ pre@@ me court held that the ho@@ ly books of the si@@ k@@ h religion was a legal person , and in 2012 , just recently , there was a treat@@ y between the indi@@ gen@@ ous peop@@ les of new ze@@ al@@ and and the cro@@ wn , in which it was agre@@ ed that a river was a legal person who ow@@ ned its own ri@@ ver@@ bed .
now , the common law is the kind of law that eng@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ speaking jud@@ ges can make when they &apos;re not cab@@ ined in by stat@@ u@@ tes or constitu@@ tions , and a wr@@ it of ha@@ be@@ us cor@@ pus is called the great wr@@ it , capital g , capital w ,
then we decided upon who our pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s are going to be .
and they ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ated the area and they found that this material culture , this way of doing it , these ro@@ cks , had passed down for at least 4@@ ,@@ 300 years through 2@@ 25 chimpan@@ zee generations .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : &quot; anything that is worth pur@@ su@@ ing is going to require us to suff@@ er , just a little bit , &quot; says sur@@ f photo@@ grapher chris bur@@ k@@ ard , as he explains his obse@@ ssion with the col@@ dest , ch@@ op@@ pie@@ st , most isol@@ ated be@@ ach@@ es on earth . with ja@@ w@@ dro@@ pping photos and stories of places few humans have ever seen -- much less surf@@ ed -- he dra@@ ws us into his &quot; personal cru@@ sa@@ de against the mun@@ dan@@ e . &quot;
i set out see@@ king ad@@ venture , and what i was finding was only rou@@ t@@ ine .
they walked off with our food and bits of our tent , clearly le@@ tting us know that we were at the bottom of the food chain and that this was their spot , not ours .

every citi@@ zen we@@ ars the bad@@ ge of the great leader at all times .
even traveling within their own country requires a travel pass .
during those months of living in their world , i often wonder@@ ed if the truth would , in fact , improve their lives .

she said she saw an aur@@ a of energy around me .
my youn@@ gest daughter did an absolutely brilliant fi@@ ve@@ -year-old thing .
and that &apos;s exactly how we felt about jen@@ es@@ is .
and they gave me , like , a little plastic zi@@ plo@@ c bag of a small amount of po@@ w@@ der .
mr : exactly , chris . there &apos;s some 3,000 people a year in the united states alone , perhaps 10 times that number worldwide , who continue to die of this illness
and all of this information stor@@ ed there will be able , in the next couple decades , once software is able to rec@@ ap@@ it@@ ul@@ ate consciousness , be able to re@@ vi@@ ve the consciousness which is im@@ min@@ ent in our mind file .
and for me personally and bin@@ a personally , we love each other like crazy .
we either saw the laun@@ ches from our back@@ y@@ ard or we saw it by driving in the hour over to the cape .
came back to earth at spe@@ eds of up to 8@@ 22 miles an hour .
it will actually heat water that will w@@ rap around my body .
this is da@@ ve clear@@ ing the air@@ space with the fa@@ a for 15 miles .
and very soon i will actually be as fast as i ever get , 8@@ 22 miles an hour .
but watch what happens when i pull it out .
it &apos;s just very , very hard . &quot;
who is out there ?
we know their size , and their or@@ bit and things like that .
it &apos;s some@@ what warm .
and this is really a field of its own .
so , we went back to the drawing board and we think we have found something very interesting in another field .
so after all of that hard work where we try to think of all the crazy g@@ ases that might be out there , and we build the very complicated space teles@@ cop@@ es that might be out there , what are we going to find ?
so i am really struc@@ k by the notion in your career of the op@@ position you fac@@ ed , that when you began thinking about ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets ,
would it surprise you ?
let me give you an example .
actually , in places like mal@@ a@@ y@@ sia , muslim women on ri@@ gs isn &apos;t even com@@ men@@ t-@@ wor@@ thy . there are that many of them .
there &apos;s a lack of opportunity , and that &apos;s due to un@@ conscious bi@@ as .
a men@@ tor who said to me , &quot; hey , your story &apos;s interesting .
thank you .
an inform@@ ant can ear@@ n 100,000 dollars or more for every terrorism case they bring to the f@@ bi .
they described his terrori@@ st ambi@@ tions as wis@@ hy@@ -@@ wash@@ y and a pi@@ pe dream scenario .
t@@ r : so the inter@@ cept is that new investig@@ ative journ@@ alism website , that &apos;s co@@ f@@ ounded by g@@ len@@ n green@@ wal@@ d .
now , i &apos;ve been making pictures for quite a long time , and normally speaking , a picture like this , for me , should be stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward .
it was about a bo@@ y@@ friend . the girl on the top , she &apos;d k@@ is@@ sed the wrong boy , and they &apos;d started having a fight .
the whole world came running ,
i sort of looked at myself standing there , going , &quot; oh , j@@ im@@ my , this is complete lo@@ ads of co@@ ds@@ w@@ all@@ op .
now , the hul@@ i are some of the most extra@@ ordin@@ arily beautiful people on the planet .
we spend the whole of our existence re@@ vol@@ ving around beauty : beautiful places , beautiful things , and ultimately , beautiful people .
the children need to che@@ w the meat all day because the adults don &apos;t have any teeth ,
first we destro@@ y , yeah ? then we reflec@@ t .
now you have no ex@@ cu@@ se . it &apos;s almost lun@@ ch@@ time , and this is not a standing o@@ v@@ ation , so don &apos;t worry ,
t@@ wa@@ in meant it as a joke , of course , but he &apos;s right :
and because you &apos;re going to see just two movies , you &apos;re going to see just two babies ,
and we can en@@ sure it &apos;s exactly the same because we have a secret com@@ part@@ ment and we actually pull the b@@ alls from there ,
take this baby , for instance .
this time , hy@@ o@@ won is going to succe@@ ed once and fail once , and so am i .
and indeed , there have been sta@@ gger@@ ing discover@@ ies in neurosci@@ ence : loc@@ ali@@ zing function@@ ally speci@@ alized regions of cortex , turning mouse brains transpar@@ ent , activ@@ ating neurons with light .
it has to be much more powerful than anything i showed you .
&lt; speaker &gt; bill gr@@ os@@ s &lt; / speaker &gt;
and that &apos;s why i came to think that the team maybe was the most important thing .
ti@@ ming accoun@@ ted for 42 percent of the difference between success and failure .
just two years later , when the co@@ de@@ c problem was solved by ado@@ be fla@@ sh and when broad@@ band pen@@ e@@ tra@@ tion cros@@ sed 50 percent in america , youtube was perfectly ti@@ med .
as john s@@ its on dan &apos;s bed , a train goes ru@@ shing by , r@@ att@@ ling everything in the room .
you just wanted to eat the piece of fruit .
if it stop@@ s us from notic@@ ing the problems that are around us , well , that &apos;s bad .
not the way we think it is .
what did we do instead ?
people understood them .
if you take a step back and look at all the box@@ es , maybe there &apos;s a way to re@@ move one or comb@@ ine them so that you can make that process much si@@ m@@ pl@@ er .
so if we focus on those tiny details , the ones we may not see and we look at them as we say , &quot; are those important or is that the way we &apos;ve always done it ?
our challenge is to wake up each day and say , &quot; how can i experience the world better ? &quot;
i remember her being be@@ aten and sl@@ apped by another member of my family .
that story lets us off the h@@ ook .
once everyone arrived in new jer@@ sey , the young girls were taken away , and put to work for 14@@ -@@ hour days , seven days a week , for five years .
tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king doesn &apos;t happen in a vacu@@ um .
i found multiple la@@ yers of pla@@ u@@ sible den@@ i@@ ability between gro@@ wer and distribu@@ tor and process@@ or , and god knows who else .
these people were the most resour@@ c@@ eful and resi@@ li@@ ent and responsible in their communities .
so let us tell it the way we should have done , from the very beginning . let us tell this story together .
it was la@@ bel@@ ed &quot; low-@@ performing and per@@ si@@ sten@@ tly dangerous &quot; due to its low test scor@@ es and high number of weapons , drugs , as@@ sa@@ ul@@ ts and arre@@ sts .
i am the princip@@ al , and having that ti@@ tle required me to lead .
they said that only 6@@ 8 percent of the kids come to school on a regular basis , 100 percent of them live in poverty ,
but because of my amazing mother , i got the ability to dream despite the poverty that surr@@ ounded me .
what are we going to do about it ? &quot;
it was quite bin@@ ary at that time .
there you are in my ear .
well , it &apos;s not like what you have with the internet .
right , so next subject is a young woman -- -- next subject , class , is a young woman called bel@@ la , a university student intervie@@ wed in 20@@ 16 during what was called an intr@@ o to femin@@ ist por@@ n class as part of her major in sex work at a college in the bay area .
oh , i &apos;m sorry , but you got to get into the spirit of it if you &apos;re going to interview me .
she said , ma@@ u@@ re@@ en fit@@ z@@ ro@@ y is the living em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the wh@@ or@@ e-@@ vir@@ g@@ in di@@ cho@@ tom@@ y .
you know , i never was a wife or a nu@@ n , or a pro@@ stitu@@ te even , really , not really .
and , in fact , most people would have been aware of issues like human tra@@ ff@@ ic@@ king , for example , but they would have seen that as quite separate from more re@@ cre@@ ational adult entertainment .
my brothers who i &apos;m close to , those guys , they &apos;re all like me .
so i &apos;m on a mission to change that .
teaching a computer to read these fac@@ ial emotions is hard , because these action un@@ its , they can be fast , they &apos;re sub@@ tle , and they comb@@ ine in many different ways .
and then e@@ ye@@ bro@@ w raised , indi@@ cat@@ or of surprise .
not only do they smile more , their s@@ miles last longer , and we can now really qu@@ anti@@ fy what it is that men and women respond to differently .
thank you .

chic@@ kens live in groups , so first of all , he selec@@ ted just an average flo@@ ck , and he let it alone for six generations .
instead , they had three character@@ ist@@ ics , the really successful teams .
but there isn &apos;t a single high-@@ tech company i &apos;ve worked with that imag@@ ines for a moment that this is a technology issue , because what drives hel@@ p@@ ful@@ ness is people getting to know each other .
when ale@@ x pen@@ t@@ land sugge@@ sted to one company that they syn@@ chron@@ ize coffee brea@@ ks so that people would have time to talk to each other , prof@@ its went up 15 million dollars , and employe@@ e satis@@ fac@@ tion went up 10 percent .
now , we need to let people motiv@@ ate each other .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : for the l@@ onge@@ st time , doctors basically ignor@@ ed the most basic and frustr@@ ating part of being sick -- pain . in this ly@@ ri@@ cal , informa@@ tive talk , la@@ ti@@ f nas@@ ser tells the extraordinary story of w@@ re@@ st@@ ler and doctor john j@@ . bon@@ ica , who per@@ su@@ aded the medical profes@@ sion to take pain seriously -- and trans@@ formed the lives of millions .
something had gone wrong with the lion tam@@ er .

ted talk subtitles and transcript : in 2011 , the us arm@@ ed forces still had a ban on women in comb@@ at -- but in that year , a special oper@@ ations team of women was sent to afghanistan to serve on the front lines , to build rapp@@ ort with loc@@ als and try to help bring an end to the war . repor@@ ter ga@@ y@@ le t@@ ze@@ m@@ ach le@@ mm@@ on tells the story of this &quot; band of si@@ sters , &quot; an extraordinary group of women war@@ ri@@ ors who helped break a long-@@ standing barri@@ er to serve .

and then , there are those of us who don &apos;t have the privilege of sitting in traffic .
we just reduc@@ ed acci@@ dents on our roads by a factor of two .
it starts by understanding where it is in the world , by taking a map and its sens@@ or data and ali@@ g@@ ning the two ,
now , the way we ac@@ comp@@ lish this is by sharing data between the vehic@@ les .
and you might notice in the bottom , we can &apos;t actually see the cy@@ cli@@ st yet , but the car can : it &apos;s that little blue box up there ,
at some point , and then a driver is going to say , &quot; this feels safe , &quot; and clim@@ b into the back , and something ug@@ ly will happen .
i spent hours sitting on it in the garden dre@@ aming of my goal .
five seconds is all it took from everything being fine to our world going black as the windows were th@@ rust underwater , and that five seconds goes quickly .
you could imagine it would be quite difficult to sleep in that situation , even as a pas@@ sen@@ ger .
and having two choices : i either put that stone to one side and learn more about it , or i put that stone back and i carry on with my dream job of sa@@ iling around the world .

it &apos;s an economy that fundamen@@ tally can &apos;t run in the long term ,
what if we could turn that into fer@@ tili@@ zer , heat , energy , ultimately re@@ connec@@ ting nutri@@ ents systems and re@@ building natural capital ?
when he was born , there were only 25 cars in the world ; they had only just been invented .
so our over@@ all commit@@ ment at the car@@ ter center is to promo@@ te human rights , and knowing the world as i do , i can tell you without any equi@@ voc@@ ation that the number one abu@@ se of human rights on earth is , stran@@ gely , not addre@@ ssed quite often , is the abu@@ se of women and girls .
ne@@ bra@@ sk@@ a this week just passed a law aboli@@ shing the death pen@@ al@@ ty , because it costs so much . so the res@@ ort to violence and abu@@ se of poor people and hel@@ ple@@ ss people is another cause of the increase in abu@@ se of women .
and the average bro@@ the@@ l ow@@ ner in atlan@@ ta and in the united states now can ear@@ n about $ 35@@ ,000 per sla@@ ve .

the average woman in eg@@ ypt doesn &apos;t have much to say about her da@@ ugh@@ ters getting gen@@ it@@ ally mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed and so forth .
but there are things that , for example , bas@@ ket@@ ball co@@ ach@@ es want to know .
or i could be wrong , they could all be pic@@ k-@@ and-@@ rol@@ ls .
it would make our lives a lot easier , but it turns out movement is very me@@ ss@@ y .
we can look at all their vel@@ o@@ cities and we can build a model that predic@@ ts what is the likel@@ i@@ hood that this shot would go in under these circum@@ stances ?
and our ability to know the shot prob@@ ability for every player at every second , and the likel@@ i@@ hood of them getting a re@@ b@@ ound at every second can illu@@ min@@ ate this moment in a way that we never could before .
okay , i will ! it was four .

there is this special day , which they call &quot; very special day &quot; where a man who is hi@@ red by the community comes to the camp and sleep@@ s with the little girls .

so we did that . it was a good thing .
manu@@ el lim@@ a : a visual history of human knowledge
the more we know about the brain , the more we think of it as a large music symp@@ hon@@ y , played by hundreds and thousands of instru@@ ments .
and what they did here is , they actually se@@ g@@ mented the network into three different years , represen@@ ted by the ver@@ tical la@@ yers that you see behind me .
at the top left , the very first project is a gene network , followed by a network of i@@ p addre@@ sses -- machines , ser@@ vers -- followed by a network of facebook friends .
as you actually navi@@ gate that space and b@@ oun@@ ce along those el@@ a@@ stic ro@@ p@@ es , the entire network kind of shif@@ ts , almost like a real organic network would .
before pol@@ ly , no one had ever told me that she &apos;d had an abor@@ tion .
and so finding ways to shift the conflict to a place of conversation is the work of my life .
i wish i could tell you that when you decide to be pro@@ -@@ voice , that you &apos;ll find beautiful moments of break@@ through and gar@@ dens full of flo@@ wers , where listening and story@@ telling creates wonderful &quot; a-@@ ha &quot; moments .
so , she decided to get comfortable .
so , last year i was pre@@ gn@@ ant again .
as a young muslim woman , i am very proud of my faith .
it teach@@ es you the importance of messa@@ ging .
why were women being rel@@ eg@@ ated to posi@@ tions which pre@@ d@@ ated the teach@@ ings of our faith ?
so ini@@ tially , i focused on the economic and political em@@ power@@ ment of women .
but we have to be at the table .
and i didn &apos;t realize i would end up going over 3@@ 0,000 miles at the start , but i ended up going and meeting lo@@ ads of different people , from a trans@@ gender cr@@ ack de@@ al@@ er in brow@@ n@@ s@@ ville , broo@@ kl@@ yn , to a scientist who sp@@ ends a lot of time fe@@ eding hallucin@@ o@@ gens to mon@@ go@@ os@@ es to see if they like them -- it turns out they do , but only in very specific circum@@ stances -- to the only country that &apos;s ever de@@ crimin@@ alized all drugs ,
if you do that , the rat will almost always pre@@ fer the drug water and almost always kill itself quite quickly .
what if addic@@ tion is about your ca@@ ge ?
one percent of the population was addic@@ ted to hero@@ in , which is kind of min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing ,
if you have a crisis in your life , you &apos;ll notice something .
so i was thinking , how could i be portu@@ gu@@ ese ?
i &apos;ve always been obse@@ ssed with how cou@@ ples meet .
he said , &quot; you &apos;re in an ele@@ v@@ ator running late for a meeting .
our contact there was george , who runs the community &apos;s photograph@@ y club .
george was actually an alco@@ ho@@ lic when they married , and mary knew it .
now , i am not one of those people .
now , i will main@@ tain@@ . and i think i can def@@ end , what may seem like a surprising statement .
so for example , take kat@@ y@@ di@@ ds ,
and part of the confu@@ sion was that they were aware of the st@@ inging ability of bees but they found it difficult to believe that any animals that bor@@ e such a weap@@ on could possibly be a female .
the way things are supposed to be .
vo@@ ic@@ eless people realized that they had a voice , and it was powerful and el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent .
imagine if this was an actual court , and the ac@@ c@@ used was in the dark , beg@@ ging for another chance , and the jury was yel@@ ling out , &quot; bor@@ ed ! soci@@ op@@ ath ! &quot;
i am beyond horri@@ fied . &#93; was anybody on twitter that night ? a few of you .
and that person got a free pass .
and if you want to know what it looks like to discover that you &apos;ve just been tor@@ n to sh@@ re@@ ds because of a mis@@ con@@ stru@@ ed liber@@ al joke , not by tro@@ l@@ ls , but by nice people like us ,
just@@ ine had 1@@ 70 twitter follo@@ wers , and so to make it work , she had to be fic@@ tion@@ alized .
so i think that &apos;s the way forward ,
ted talk subtitles and transcript : when artist sal@@ vat@@ ore i@@ ac@@ on@@ es@@ i was diagnos@@ ed with brain cancer , he refu@@ sed to be a pas@@ sive patient -- which , he points out , means &quot; one who wa@@ its . &quot; so he hac@@ ked his brain sc@@ ans , po@@ sted them online , and invited a global community to pit@@ ch in on a &quot; cure . &quot; this sometimes meant medical advice , and it sometimes meant art , music , emotional support -- from more than half a million people .
and , obviously , doctors are the good guys in all these scenari@@ os ,
the la cur@@ a website went vir@@ al .
which was very intense ,
for the min@@ ar@@ et , i thought that the most relevant message to be put on a mos@@ que should come from the qu@@ ran ,
in south africa , in cape town , the local community of phili@@ pp@@ i off@@ ered me the only concrete wall of the slu@@ m .
that was made in 19@@ 37 by the general dra@@ f@@ ting company .
and the world would be a different place if we projec@@ ted europe to show it in its actual size .
and i became a lear@@ ner , because i found myself
it wasn &apos;t a form@@ al , organized learning process , and i &apos;m happy to ad@@ mit that .
contra@@ sted to the scor@@ ching desert that surr@@ ounds this place , so are these people .
but i think in a lot of ways , the youtube page rese@@ mb@@ les a classroom .
just like the sing@@ ular of &quot; she@@ ep &quot; should be &quot; shoo@@ p . &quot;

ted talk subtitles and transcript : seven@@ ty thousand years ago , our human ance@@ stors were in@@ significant animals , just min@@ ding their own business in a corner of africa with all the other animals . but now , few would disa@@ gre@@ e that humans domin@@ ate planet earth ; we &apos;ve spread to every continent , and our actions deter@@ mine the f@@ ate of other animals . how did we get from there to here ? histor@@ ian y@@ u@@ val no@@ ah har@@ ari suggests a surprising reason for the rise of humanity .
are you a nice chimpan@@ zee ?
pri@@ sons are a system of cooper@@ ation ;
but what i want to emp@@ ha@@ size is that exactly the same mechanism under@@ lies all other forms of mass@@ -@@ scale human cooper@@ ation , not only in the religious field .
mostly , they try to make money .
all other animals live in an objec@@ tive reality .
bg : ok , so you &apos;re basically saying in the book and now , that for all the discussion about the growing evidence of significant economic ine@@ quality , we are just kind of at the beginning of the process ?
in the 18@@ 50@@ s , bri@@ g@@ ham young disp@@ at@@ ched families to st@@ . george to grow co@@ tton because of the hot , ar@@ id climate .
but it wasn &apos;t all fun .
about a seven@@ -@@ minute drive from my hidden lake cab@@ in was the comp@@ ound of ar@@ yan nations , the white su@@ pre@@ mac@@ ist group .
many whit@@ op@@ i@@ ans feel pu@@ shed by illeg@@ als , social wel@@ f@@ are abu@@ se , min@@ orities , den@@ sity , crow@@ ded schools .
&lt; doc docid = &quot; 23@@ 10 &quot; genre = &quot; lectures &quot; &gt;
thank you .
and after 18 months of hard work , i went on to do incredible things .
in addition to this , it trac@@ ks eye contact through camera and simul@@ ates a public@@ -@@ speaking and jo@@ b@@ -@@ interview experience .
&lt; speaker &gt; eli@@ za@@ beth n@@ ya@@ may@@ ar@@ o &lt; / speaker &gt;
i felt gu@@ il@@ ty .
and that &apos;s when the e@@ ma@@ ils started p@@ our@@ ing in , sometimes as many as a thousand a day .
now , eight months later , a movement is building .
for much of this time , this assi@@ stance was manu@@ al .
it &apos;s the de@@ fa@@ ult piece that matters .
and so right now , you probably have the tools to th@@ wart many kinds of government surveil@@ lance already on your phones and already in your po@@ ckets ,
if we think about the scale of size , start with an everyday object like the ten@@ nis ball , and just go down orders of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de in size -- from the eye of a need@@ le down to a cell , down to a bacteri@@ um , down to an enz@@ y@@ me -- you eventually reach the nan@@ o-@@ world .
so does all in@@ anim@@ ate matter , made up of tril@@ lions of atoms .
well , one man beg@@ ged to diff@@ er with this idea . er@@ win sch@@ r@@ ö@@ ding@@ er , of sch@@ r@@ ö@@ ding@@ er &apos;s cat f@@ ame , was an au@@ stri@@ an physici@@ st .
in fact , it &apos;s the reason our sun sh@@ ines .
the question is : how likely are they to do that , and if they do , how do they do it ?
to give it direc@@ tional information -- a buil@@ t-@@ in compas@@ s .
sounds familiar ?
why is that those vacc@@ ines are just going into clinical trials now ?
and make no mistake about it -- it &apos;s not a question of &quot; if , &quot; but &quot; when . &quot;
being able to see damage from ang@@ les you can &apos;t get from bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars on the ground or from a satellite image , or anything flying at a higher angle .
that was a huge problem at the ha@@ iti earth@@ qua@@ ke .
it &apos;s not making more sens@@ ors .
we can shor@@ ten it that way .
and our ance@@ stors , for as long as there &apos;s been recorded history , have looked at the night sky and p@@ onder@@ ed the nature of our existence .
the scale is compar@@ able in he@@ ight ; in fact , it &apos;s smaller than this telescope will be .
and each of those galaxies may con@@ tain within it a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars .
and there have even been planets that have been spec@@ ul@@ ated diam@@ ond worlds .
over this entire 27 feet .
we &apos;ve cast the second and the third mir@@ r@@ ors .
&lt; / doc &gt;
not that i &apos;m sugge@@ sting anyone in this audience would use it to go and pro@@ cure high-@@ quality nar@@ co@@ tics .
i do hope we can do business together .
but then they realized there was a problem with bit@@ co@@ in , because every bit@@ co@@ in trans@@ action is actually recorded public@@ ly in a public le@@ d@@ ger .
we &apos;re worried about who might be watching us .
&lt; / doc &gt;
i &apos;m not talking about the technology of things , profound though that is .
so the work example is mer@@ ely an example of how fal@@ se ideas can create a circum@@ stance that ends up making them true .
i would like you to feel comfortable with my doing that by le@@ tting you know that i know something about fear and an@@ x@@ iety .
we susp@@ ended our values .
and so the parts of the u.s. government that do fore@@ sight , that look forward , that do strategy -- the parts in other governments that do this -- can &apos;t do it , because they &apos;re reac@@ ting to the news cycle .
and we know this because we &apos;ve been in it for several years .
we &apos;re now seeing that our basic assump@@ tions about the internet -- that it was going to connect us , wea@@ ve society together -- are not necessarily true .
and that gets us to another break@@ down that &apos;s cruci@@ al , and another break@@ down that couldn &apos;t be more important to a group like this ,
these are fundamental issues . where are the philosoph@@ ers ?
p@@ at mit@@ chel@@ l : good !
so you can have a law , but it &apos;s changing the he@@ arts and minds to match up with it .
b@@ j@@ k : i think it goes back to an ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any i had at 12 .
every single person .
but what you &apos;ve just looked at is this millen@@ ni@@ al generation , who have benef@@ ited from all these equal opportunities -- which may not be equal but exist everywhere -- b@@ j@@ k : first of all , i &apos;m really lucky . partner@@ ship with ten@@ e@@ o , a strate@@ gic company that &apos;s amazing .
i &apos;ve been talking to the boo@@ mers , who are their bos@@ ses , and i go , &quot; what do you think about the millen@@ ni@@ als ? &quot;
and you heard president car@@ ter talk about how ti@@ tle i@@ x is protected .
and every one of you is an influ@@ en@@ cer .
they met when they all had small children , through a par@@ en@@ ting class at a family resource center in san francisco .
and her mother was he@@ art@@ broken over what was happening .
it &apos;s a home for poe@@ ts , musici@@ ans and artists .
i &apos;ve built a career .
what if we recogni@@ zed that what &apos;s working is the people and what &apos;s broken is our approach ?
let &apos;s use some of our sub@@ stan@@ tial collective power toward inven@@ ting and bringing to life new ways of being that work for us .
so we did what graduate students typically do in a situation like that .
i &apos;m kind of the gen@@ eric person .
this results in a syn@@ dro@@ me that i like to call &apos; pre@@ mat@@ ure self-@@ con@@ grat@@ ula@@ tion . &apos;
if you listen to what men say about what they want in their lives , gender equality is actually a way for us to get the lives we want to live .
and they &apos;re in a terrible accident , and the father is killed ,
and i &apos;m going to pro@@ pose something a little bit more radical , one word : &quot; share . &quot;
but i think it shows something important ,
i dedic@@ ated my presi@@ den@@ cy to having a space for those who felt mar@@ gin@@ alized on the island of i@@ rel@@ and ,
it was later when i started to work in african countries on issues of development and human rights .
in our very un@@ equal world today , it &apos;s very stri@@ king how many people are left behind .
in ha@@ wa@@ ii , they &apos;re passing leg@@ is@@ lation to have 100 percent renewa@@ ble energy by 20@@ 45 .
and indeed a few years later , the universal dec@@ lar@@ ation of human rights .
i was mar@@ ching with some of the elders family , and i saw a plac@@ ard a little bit away from me , but we were wed@@ ged so clos@@ ely together -- because after all , there were 40@@ 0,000 people out in the streets of new york -- so i couldn &apos;t quite get to that plac@@ ard , i would have just liked to have been able to step behind it , because it said , &quot; an@@ gry gran@@ ni@@ es ! &quot;
&lt; / doc &gt;
in my lifetime , countries had dis@@ appeared -- c@@ ze@@ ch@@ os@@ lo@@ va@@ ki@@ a ; appeared -- ti@@ mor@@ -@@ le@@ ste ; failed -- som@@ ali@@ a .
&quot; i &apos;m not a national , &quot; i pro@@ cla@@ im@@ ed on@@ stage . &quot; i &apos;m a local . i &apos;m multi-@@ local . &quot;
we took off our shoes in the house , we were un@@ fail@@ ingly pol@@ ite with our elders , we ate slo@@ w-@@ coo@@ ked , sp@@ ic@@ y food .
i have a friend named ol@@ u .
of course , when we ask , &quot; where are you from ? &quot;
here &apos;s one possibility : basically , countries represent power .
the more we know about where a story is set , the more local color and tex@@ ture , the more human the characters start to feel ,
and why is story@@ telling important ?
when our ance@@ stors first came here , they war@@ ned , &quot; stay out of these areas , they &apos;re ha@@ un@@ ted .
and this is a natural process that &apos;s occur@@ red for thousands of years and we &apos;re just now learning about it .
for better or for worse , the story of the ever@@ gla@@ des is intr@@ in@@ sically ti@@ ed to the pe@@ a@@ ks and the valle@@ ys of man@@ kind &apos;s relationship with the natural world .
so i built this sub@@ mer@@ ged platform that would hold sna@@ ils just right under the water . and i spent months planning this crazy idea .
it won &apos;t happen because they &apos;re so u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous , we see them now , they &apos;re one of the great conservation success stories of the us .
we &apos;re slowly under@@ taking these projects to bring more fre@@ sh@@ water back to the bay .
if we pass it , we get to keep the planet .
i feel di@@ stil@@ led by it , and i actually very much like the woman i &apos;m di@@ stil@@ ling into .
ski@@ p over all the pages reas@@ sur@@ ing religious people .
st@@ are as long as you need to .
to have come to this place , lived to this moment : im@@ measu@@ ra@@ ble ligh@@ t@@ ness .
you can imagine as a child what i went through .
i had a good life .
it helped me to support my family , to bring my family to another country , to be safe .
thank you .
and you know , i just looked at them , and i said , &quot; what school ? where is the school ? &quot;
i was very happy . i was del@@ igh@@ ted with the outcome of my work .
you train women , you teach them and also you give them an opportunity to have a job .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s not you . what &apos;s wrong with you ? &quot;
so we started training men because the men should know the potential of women , know how much these potential men has , and how much these women can do the same job they are doing .
&lt; / doc &gt;
it could even cause some dea@@ ths .
and our buildings are designed to be comfortable within a particular temperature range .
we also know that we have to de@@ car@@ bon@@ ize our energy system .
and this app@@ lies to all of us , whatever sphere of influence we have .
there &apos;s still some confu@@ sion about that question , as this is a fairly new field of research .
so in an animal model of depression , we have seen that we have a lower level of neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
i will let you ju@@ dge that one by yourself .
and on your side -- i leave you in charge of your neuro@@ gen@@ es@@ is .
now , the reason for the domin@@ ance of this model is of course the antibio@@ tic revolution .
and we begin with a self-@@ regul@@ ating , se@@ mi@@ -@@ autonom@@ ous unit called a cell .
and we now know that what you really probably need to do is to change the phy@@ si@@ ology of the or@@ gan , the brain , re@@ wire it , re@@ model it ,
nothing happened .
they &apos;re also , number three , the most efficient re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ers of frac@@ tures that we &apos;ve ever encoun@@ tered .
could that stop some of the de@@ generation ?
thank you .
michael green : how we can make the world a better place by 20@@ 30
well , a lot of it was because of economic growth .
so there &apos;s our target , 75 out of 100 .
now this seems a bit strange .
and that &apos;s really important , because it tells us two things .
and i want to finish by showing you a way to do that , called the people &apos;s report card .
then we can really see , how are we doing ?
but then , after a month , the police in nor@@ way got a message from the police in the ne@@ ther@@ lands .
but it is also a story about what it &apos;s like to be a refuge@@ e in europe today .
and we did dna sam@@ ples of him , and later on got addi@@ tional dna sam@@ ples from mou@@ a@@ z &apos;s clos@@ est rel@@ ative who now lives in jor@@ dan .
and the woman in the shop was the last person we know of to have seen them alive .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m in cal@@ a@@ is . i need you to come get my back@@ pack and my laptop .
they had a difficult time , but they were positive , they had hope .
is there any stri@@ p ligh@@ ting in your happy place ?
fortunately , the big tech companies seem to agree .
most of all , we wanted to create an inti@@ mate , beautiful thing that could live in your po@@ cket and be loved .
we are the people that actually build our world , there are no artificial intelligen@@ ces ...
kar@@ stic regions cover almost 20 percent of the contin@@ ents &apos; surface , and we know actually that sp@@ ele@@ ologists in the last 50 years have explor@@ ed roughly 3@@ 0,000 kilometers of cave passa@@ ges around the world , which is a big number .
so how can it be possible ?
and the ca@@ ves represent , really , a sn@@ ap@@ shot of the past .
and we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems , and each one with its own un@@ discovered world .
bg : fran@@ ces@@ co , gra@@ zie . fs : gra@@ zie .
we couldn &apos;t believe this was happening .
thir@@ ty percent of our text messages are about su@@ ici@@ de and depression -- huge .
we had a spi@@ ke in volume also .
i &apos;m inspired -- i want to use tech and data to make the world a better place .
and el@@ la says to me that she is repe@@ ating the cycle of her own mother &apos;s life before her .
when did you go to school ? &quot;
and in a really short space of time , something new started to grow : a relationship between the team and the workers .
but at the same time , be@@ ver@@ id@@ ge so@@ wed the se@@ eds of today &apos;s challenges .
and dam@@ on , who runs the local circle , calls her back and says , &quot; how can i help ? &quot;
but here , too , the systems are fa@@ iling .
&lt; / doc &gt;
if people are sp@@ ying on us , it stands to reason that they have to listen to what we are saying .
we also organized gu@@ i@@ ded t@@ ours to experience and sound out the power con@@ stel@@ lations on-@@ site .
in the world of glob@@ alization , the contin@@ ents are dri@@ f@@ ting closer to each other .
we have also establi@@ shed communication systems in remote refuge@@ e centers in swit@@ zer@@ land and gre@@ e@@ ce .
bg : and allow them to talk as well .
am i doing enough ?
they &apos;re no@@ c@@ tur@@ n@@ al , sol@@ it@@ ary , very el@@ u@@ sive animals , and we got started getting very basic data about these animals .
when the portu@@ gu@@ ese first arrived in brazil , beginning european colon@@ i@@ zation in the ea@@ stern part of south america .
the situation in the cer@@ ra@@ do made me realize -- it gave me the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy .
these animals de@@ serve to be car@@ ed for .
i wanted to find a way to also use existing infrastructure to recei@@ ve data from our li@@ -@@ fi lights .
so now this led lam@@ p here is stre@@ aming a video by changing the bri@@ ght@@ ness of the led in a very sub@@ tle way , and in a way that you can &apos;t recognize with your eye ,
&lt; / doc &gt;
you &apos;re looking for knowledge , which is something way more complicated and del@@ ic@@ ate .
there was a picture distribu@@ ted wi@@ del@@ y over the internet where her face was di@@ stor@@ ted to look like a mon@@ key .
and if there was somebody who immediately understood this ,
&quot; we like you , we dis@@ like you .
we accept things in our religious lives that we do not accept in our se@@ cu@@ lar lives ,
i had help rais@@ ing my little daughter .
and what it caused me to do was def@@ end myself and my people and everything we believe in , because we &apos;re not stupid .
in fact , my own religion has had an enormous effect on this nation .
and we had to step back and watch men get into the meeting as young as 12 years old , es@@ cor@@ ted and walked past us as we all stood in line .
i found a different question to ask animals .
mostly bo@@ iled .
it turns out that if you record the voices of tou@@ ri@@ sts and you play that recor@@ ding from a speaker hidden in bu@@ shes , eleph@@ ants will ignor@@ e it , because tou@@ ri@@ sts never bo@@ ther eleph@@ ants .
empathy is old , but empathy , like everything else in life , comes on a sli@@ ding scale and has its el@@ abor@@ ation .
but we see other animals and we say , &quot; oh look , kill@@ er wh@@ ales , wol@@ ves , eleph@@ ants :
in yel@@ lo@@ w@@ stone national park , we killed every single wol@@ f .

when human beings use one thing to represent another , we call that art .
and every one of those animals in every painting of no@@ ah &apos;s ar@@ k , de@@ em@@ ed wor@@ thy of sal@@ v@@ ation is in mor@@ tal danger now , and their fl@@ ood is us .
i mean -- me , it makes sense , right ?
over the last century , more than 3@@ 50 ice age rock art sites have been found across the continent , de@@ cor@@ ated with animals , abstract shapes and even the occa@@ sion@@ al human like these en@@ gra@@ ved figu@@ res from gro@@ tta del@@ l &apos;@@ ad@@ da@@ ur@@ a in sic@@ ily .
some signs start out strong , before losing pop@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity and van@@ ishing , while other signs are later inven@@ tions .

you should never picture yourself up there .
though the journey was extraordinary , i do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fu@@ eling my body .

and i guar@@ an@@ te@@ e it &apos;s absolute magic .
when was it that you yourself realized that there might be im@@ pen@@ ding per@@ il for your country ?
but they aren &apos;t supposed to come back .
but even that , it &apos;s going to be very , very difficult to get the kind of resour@@ cing that we would need .
ca : it must have been just an extra@@ ordin@@ arily emotional day because of these questions about identity , the joy of seeing you and perhaps an emp@@ ha@@ si@@ zed sense of what they had lost .
we don &apos;t have a lot of li@@ ve@@ stock , so it &apos;s fish that we dep@@ end on .
ca : so there &apos;s so many things playing into this .
is it getting harder ? are the wat@@ ers de@@ ple@@ ted ?
and it seems like it &apos;s very possible that your nation , despite , actually because of the intense problems you face , you may yet be the war@@ ning light to the world that sh@@ ines most vi@@ si@@ bly , most power@@ fully .

and i sent a copy out to each of my volunte@@ ers .
if we all read more wi@@ del@@ y , there &apos;d be more in@@ cen@@ tive for publi@@ sh@@ ers to translat@@ e more books , and we would all be rich@@ er for that .
of course , my brothers were not happy about it ,

bg : we &apos;ll come back to that too , but you mentioned the cu@@ tting of funding and the vou@@ ch@@ ers from the world food program@@ me .
because you are talking about children in school , you are talking about health , you are talking about infrastructure that is over@@ crow@@ ded .
because they see refuge@@ es as people that should be with the cali@@ ph@@ ate and are fle@@ e@@ ing to the cru@@ sa@@ ders .

chris anderson : this is such a strange thing .
tell us how you got to understand open source and how it lead to the development of lin@@ u@@ x .

when you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people , which -- i mean , right now we &apos;re in the situation where just on the ker@@ nel , we have 1,000 people involved in every single release and that &apos;s every two months , roughly two or three months .
i was not a people person back then .
ca : but during the actual development of lin@@ u@@ x itself , that stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people .
you need to have the peop@@ le-@@ people , the communic@@ ators , the warm and friend@@ ly people who like -- really want to hu@@ g you and get you into the community .
so they &apos;re two completely different cases .
but i &apos;m looking at the ground , and i want to fix the po@@ tho@@ le that &apos;s right in front of me before i fall in .

and when i was 12 and in my first year of high school , i started rais@@ ing money for communities in the developing world .
and it suddenly explo@@ ded one day when we got a phone call from bon@@ o , the edge and pe@@ ar@@ l j@@ am , who all agre@@ ed to head@@ line our conc@@ ert .
so we had to somehow rec@@ ru@@ it and activ@@ ate millions of citizens in do@@ zens of countries to put pressure on their leaders to be@@ have al@@ tru@@ ist@@ ically .
she started writing letters , e@@ ma@@ iling politicians &apos; off@@ ices .

my mom takes three elements : a bit of information , which is between my father and my mom in this case , ra@@ w elements and energy in the same media , that is food , and after several months , produc@@ es me .
so i was thinking how i could explain myself better about how big and enormous this code is .
a wonderful book , a mi@@ gh@@ ty book , a mi@@ gh@@ ty book that helped me understand and show you something quite remarkable .
we started from the beginning , from common tra@@ its .
so we take the real face of a subject , we reduce the complexity , because not everything is in your face -- lots of fe@@ atures and de@@ fec@@ ts and as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tries come from your life .
in the vi@@ al of blood , we predic@@ ted he &apos;s a male .
we do it because the same technology and the same approach , the machine learning of this code , is helping us to understand how we work , how your body works , how your body ages , how disease gener@@ ates in your body , how your cancer gro@@ ws and develop@@ s , how drugs work and if they work on your body .
so this is a talk about gene drives , but i &apos;m going to start by telling you a brief story .
i &apos;ll keep this quick , but men@@ deli@@ an gene@@ tics says when a male and a female mate , their baby inher@@ its half of its dna from each par@@ ent .
so , what does this mean ? for one thing , it means we have a very powerful , but also some@@ what al@@ ar@@ ming new tool .
but it &apos;s also true that if a dozen a@@ si@@ an car@@ p with the all-@@ male gene drive acci@@ den@@ tally got car@@ ried from the great la@@ kes back to asia , they could potentially wi@@ pe out the n@@ ative a@@ si@@ an car@@ p population .
in eleph@@ ants or people , it would take centu@@ ries for a tra@@ it to spread wi@@ del@@ y enough to matter .
by that i mean , not just the choice to use a gene drive , but also the choice not to use one .
jim o &apos;@@ gra@@ dy : so i &apos;m ban@@ ging out my story and i know it &apos;s good , and then i start to make it better -- by ad@@ ding an element of em@@ bel@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
and now listen to the click .
and if we are right , there &apos;s a strong predic@@ tion over here
so i know that if you are completely confu@@ sed now , and i do hope that this is not the case , your brain respon@@ ses are very different than mine .
so to test it in the lab , we did the following experiment .
and think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and cou@@ pl@@ ing to other people in your life .
of the 30 astron@@ au@@ ts in the original mer@@ cur@@ y , ge@@ min@@ i and apol@@ lo programs , only seven marri@@ ages survi@@ ved .
i &apos;m talking about dre@@ aming
what if we experimen@@ ted with creating that kind of world these next few days ?
now when i say that , what most people hear me say is that we &apos;re working on cur@@ ing cancer .
it sounds a little bit like science fiction .
we designed these nan@@ op@@ artic@@ les to be activ@@ ated by these enz@@ y@@ mes .
but i think we all have to have dreams to keep us pu@@ shing forward , even -- and maybe especially -- cancer researchers .
but we only had three days to make it , and the only fabri@@ c we had was an old du@@ vet cover that another resi@@ dent left behind .
we were both artists down@@ town .
and she would draw her fing@@ er@@ tip down over my face so slowly that i couldn &apos;t feel it moving .
another rule is that all mass is subject to en@@ trop@@ y .
an answer wor@@ thy of my wife .
what we found was that flight simul@@ ators had been pro@@ ven over and over again to be far more effective when used in combination with real , in-@@ flight training to train the pil@@ o@@ ts .
and what they found was a surpri@@ sing@@ ly high 7@@ 6 percent increase in the learning effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess when using virtual laborat@@ ories over traditional teaching metho@@ ds . but even more interest@@ ingly ,
and it really feels like it , you have to try this .

so let &apos;s start with under@@ gra@@ ds and law school students , who typically have limited experience with children .
we know that underneath our fac@@ ial skin , there &apos;s a rich network of blood ves@@ sels .
and perhaps in the future , their risks for heart attack or hyper@@ ten@@ sion .
each one &apos;s got three different mo@@ tors , so now you can build things that move .
what happens is , these guys start multi@@ pl@@ ying and they fill up this entire sc@@ aff@@ old .
and when we image them in the lab , you can see how the cell@@ ul@@ ose forms these structures .
one natural idea is that the de@@ e@@ pest aspec@@ ts of human thought -- our ability to imagine , to be conscious , to dream -- have always been the same .
one is just asking the experts , a bit like we do with dic@@ tion@@ aries .
and one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true in a different , independent tradition .
so i picked up the phone , and i called pol@@ o , and in fact he was not feeling well .
you know , the security environment in som@@ ali@@ a at that moment in time -- and nothing has really changed too much -- can best be described as &quot; mad ma@@ x &quot; by way of &quot; a c@@ loc@@ k@@ work oran@@ ge . &quot;
and so now the important part : can anything be done about this ?
now , we can have a circu@@ lar argument here about whether this increase in fat@@ alities is a response to the increase of small arms , or the other way around .
but know that how you give is just as important as how much you give .
each moment or photograph represents a tan@@ gi@@ ble piece of our memor@@ ies as time pas@@ ses .
i got to the set and realized : it &apos;s a square .
now when i do these pictures , it &apos;s literally like a real-@@ time puzzle going on in my mind .
and if you look clos@@ ely in this picture , you can actually see time changing in those large television sets .
they would walk up , take a picture , and then walk away .
&lt; speaker &gt; c@@ é@@ dri@@ c vil@@ lan@@ i &lt; / speaker &gt;
and still , their statistics can be accur@@ ately predic@@ ted by mathematical physics .
but cle@@ ver er@@ at@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es , using mathematics , was able to measure the earth with an amazing accur@@ acy of two percent .
this algorith@@ m uses the laws of mathematical rand@@ om@@ ness to deter@@ mine automati@@ cally the most relevant web pages , in the same way as we used rand@@ om@@ ness in the gal@@ ton board experiment .
let me e@@ vo@@ ke for you one of the most stri@@ king days in my mathema@@ tici@@ an &apos;s life .
it &apos;s just a complete battle between the problem and you .
they are a min@@ ority , but they over@@ comp@@ ens@@ ate by being extra l@@ oud .
why com@@ edy ?
fact : mu@@ sli@@ ms invented just@@ in ti@@ mber@@ lake .
so we walked into these ban@@ ks in the ca@@ y@@ man islands and asked if we could open up a bank account with eight dollars and 27 cents .
in the fight against extreme poverty , i believe there are three powerful le@@ vers that we can le@@ an on .
global poverty has powerful le@@ vers .
she is physically strong , men@@ tally tough , and she will do whatever it takes to ear@@ n a better life for her children .
we don &apos;t need more geni@@ us types right now .
today , we have 2,000 of these rural field offic@@ ers growing very quickly .
in fact , for the first time in human history , we have a vast amount of deli@@ very infrastructure available to us .
until every girl like this one has an opportunity to ear@@ n her full human potential , we have failed to become a truly moral and just human race .
most people associ@@ ate this type of action with gand@@ hi and martin lu@@ ther king .
at one point , the organi@@ zers deliver@@ ed hundreds of eg@@ gs to various government buildings with a message : &quot; if you don &apos;t have the hu@@ e@@ vo@@ s &quot; -- the b@@ alls -- &quot; to stop cor@@ ru@@ pt can@@ di@@ dates from running for office , you can bor@@ row ours . &quot;
this is dangerous , because we now know that our old approach@@ es of dealing with conflict are not ade@@ qu@@ ate for the new challenges that we &apos;re facing .
i spend a lot of my time thinking about how to spend my time .
and the thing is that , again , knowing exactly how this works -- and i &apos;m a designer , i know exactly how the psychology of this works , i know exactly what &apos;s going on -- but it doesn &apos;t leave me with any choice , i still just get suc@@ ked into it .
nan@@ cy might want to dis@@ connect , but then she &apos;d be worried : what if i &apos;m missing something important ?
he jo@@ ked in our conversation that what if , instead of a spel@@ l check , you had a compassion check , meaning , you might high@@ light a word that might be acci@@ den@@ tally ab@@ ra@@ sive -- percei@@ ved as ab@@ ra@@ sive by someone else .
can you imagine a whole world that worked this way ?
maybe you &apos;re not doing so well to start with , but let &apos;s start that conversation .
there are 1 million such schools in india .
but anyway , we jump@@ ed right in and as we jump@@ ed in , all sorts of ideas started flying at us .
has the toilet been made , has the me@@ al been served .
he doesn &apos;t have the addi@@ tional money , he doesn &apos;t have the resources .
i like to call it &quot; the chain of hope . &quot;
learning levels of children have stopped dec@@ lin@@ ing , and they have started going up .
but today , i &apos;m going to pick three i find interesting and share what actually it re@@ minds me about laun@@ ching new products and services .
or do they accept that this is the only truth ?
it re@@ minds me that the world &apos;s in flu@@ x , and we have to respond to those changes .
the answer is rar@@ ely inside the building .
we named it am@@ bl@@ y@@ op@@ sis ho@@ osi@@ er@@ i , the ho@@ os@@ ier ca@@ ve@@ fish .
&lt; / doc &gt;
they compared dre@@ y@@ f@@ us &apos;s hand@@ writing to that on the me@@ mo and conclu@@ ded that it was a match , even though outside professional hand@@ writing experts were much less confi@@ dent in the simil@@ ar@@ ity , but never mind that .
so this is why i call motiv@@ ated reas@@ oning , &quot; sol@@ dier mind@@ set . &quot;
but it took him 10 years , and for part of that time , he himself was in prison for the crime of dis@@ lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to the army .
he said , &quot; if you want to build a ship , don &apos;t dru@@ m up your men to collect wood and give orders and distribu@@ te the work .
what they came up with was actually quite interesting .
so we began cul@@ ti@@ v@@ ating these products , these microbes , in our lab . we found that we can make essential amin@@ o ac@@ ids from carbon dioxide using these microbes .
let me give you a specific example . in in@@ don@@ e@@ sia , an amount of vir@@ g@@ in rain@@ forest was clear@@ ed to@@ tal@@ ing the size of appro@@ xim@@ ately i@@ rel@@ and ,
that means we can make cro@@ ps much faster than we &apos;re making them today .
hi . my name is mar@@ wa , and i &apos;m an architect .
and that reason is architecture .
over time , the united city has mor@@ ph@@ ed into a city center with g@@ het@@ to@@ s along its circum@@ fer@@ ence .
in that sense , sett@@ le@@ ment , identity and social inte@@ gra@@ tion are all the produc@@ er and product of effective ur@@ ban@@ ism .
so that was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for me , and it was an im@@ men@@ se sho@@ ck for many people , but it was also something that , over the following several days , created a complete political mel@@ t@@ down in my country .
those divi@@ sions are things we really need to recognize and take seriously .
this was a prote@@ st vote for many , a sense that nobody represen@@ ted them , that they couldn &apos;t find a political party that spoke for them ,
how can we balance on the one hand addre@@ ssing fear and ali@@ en@@ ation while on the other hand refu@@ sing ve@@ he@@ men@@ tly to give in to x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia and nation@@ alism ?
this illu@@ stra@@ tion from the financial times post-@@ bre@@ x@@ it is really stri@@ king .
&lt; / doc &gt;
a few others and i today make these forests profession@@ ally -- anywhere and everywhere .
that would be the industrial way . it goes against nature .
when it &apos;s cold , fr@@ ost forma@@ tion happens only on the mul@@ ch , so soil can still brea@@ the while it &apos;s free@@ zing outside .
once establi@@ shed , these forests are going to re@@ generate themselves again and again -- probably forever .
and this is a term that some ge@@ ologists are sugge@@ sting we should give to our current e@@ po@@ ch , given how per@@ va@@ sive human influence has been over it .
and he said , &quot; the amazon . &quot;
and there &apos;s an interesting little parado@@ x , too .
so this means that they &apos;re only available to the el@@ ites ,
so scientists have started calling ecosyste@@ ms like these &quot; novel ecosyste@@ ms , &quot; because they &apos;re often domin@@ ated by non-@@ n@@ ative species , and because they &apos;re just super weird .
which is that we have to let children touch nature , because that which is un@@ tou@@ ched is un@@ loved .
the first time i enter@@ ed man@@ shi@@ y@@ at nas@@ er , it felt like a ma@@ ze .
so for man@@ shi@@ y@@ at nas@@ er , i decided to write in arab@@ ic the words of st@@ . a@@ than@@ a@@ si@@ us of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , a cop@@ tic b@@ ish@@ op from the third century , who said : , which means in english , &quot; anyone who wants to see the sun@@ light clearly needs to wi@@ pe his eyes first . &quot; it was really important for me that the community felt connected to the words .
they just work out of it .
the house of un@@ cle ba@@ k@@ heet and a@@ un@@ ty f@@ are@@ eda was this kind of meeting point .
thank you .
so what we &apos;ve learned over the first century of neurosci@@ ence is that the brain is a very complicated network , made out of very speci@@ alized cells called neurons with very complex geome@@ tries ,
you can &apos;t look at these tiny connections .
because we could potentially move everything apart in the brain .
so one kind of biom@@ o@@ lec@@ u@@ le might get a blue color . another kind of biom@@ o@@ lec@@ u@@ le might get a red color .
it turns out that throughout bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ ine , there are other problems that ex@@ pan@@ sion might help with .
