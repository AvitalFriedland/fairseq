last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
but this under@@ states the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ic@@ kness of the ice .
the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contrac@@ ts in summer .
the next slide i show you will be a rap@@ id fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the permanent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue --
that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in winter ,
and it contrac@@ ts in summer .
the so-@@ called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ il@@ ling out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the ar@@ c@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it tha@@ ws , is turned into me@@ than@@ e by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
already in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ than@@ e is acti@@ vely bu@@ bb@@ ling up out of the water .
professor kat@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ allow lake last winter .
video : who@@ a ! al gore : she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
but the volu@@ mes are much larger than ever .
this is the kan@@ ger@@ lu@@ s@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level ri@@ ses from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it reach@@ es the sea .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists repor@@ ted the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west antarctica cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly rap@@ id in its mel@@ ting .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ y@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were glac@@ i@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drin@@ king water from that mel@@ ting flow .
in the and@@ es , this glac@@ ier is the source of drin@@ king water for this city .
the flo@@ ws have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drin@@ king water .
in california there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the sier@@ ra sno@@ w@@ pack .
this is hit@@ ting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fi@@ res .
and the disa@@ sters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ prece@@ den@@ ted rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours --
25 million tons every day to the oceans . look carefully at the area of the ea@@ stern pacific , from the americ@@ as , exten@@ ding we@@ st@@ ward , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ forest@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .
and the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green altern@@ atives pro@@ posed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
and the coal industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ en@@ dar year promo@@ ting clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion gall@@ ons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ il@@ led .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
video : ♪ ♫ fro@@ sty the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
he &apos;s ab@@ un@@ d@@ ant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday .
he &apos;s af@@ for@@ d@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
al gore : this is the source of much of the coal in west vir@@ gin@@ ia .
the largest moun@@ tain@@ top min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
video : don blan@@ ken@@ ship : let me be clear about it . al gore , nan@@ cy pel@@ os@@ i , har@@ ry re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
al gore : so the al@@ li@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
video : actor : at co@@ al@@ er@@ gy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adver@@ ti@@ sing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- smel@@ ls good , too .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
video : actor : clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of-@@ the-@@ art clean coal fac@@ ility .
amazing ! the machin@@ ery is kind of l@@ oud .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while bur@@ ning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
al gore : finally , the positive alternative me@@ shes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
video : nar@@ r@@ ator : america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thre@@ ad that links them all : our addic@@ tion to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this me@@ ss .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
re@@ power america . find out more .
al gore : this is the last one .
video : nar@@ r@@ ator : it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
one of the fa@@ ste@@ st ways to cut our depen@@ dence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
man : future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy gri@@ d .
man # 2 : new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
nar@@ r@@ ator : re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
al gore : there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introduc@@ tion to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever at@@ temp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ fer@@ ence .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a bil@@ li@@ ont@@ h of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
this is the machine below gene@@ va .
we take the pictures of those mini@@ -@@ big ban@@ gs inside dete@@ ctors . this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las dete@@ ctor -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in dia@@ meter .
spectac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
it caused im@@ men@@ se cele@@ bra@@ tion in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the dete@@ ctor .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
those wi@@ res carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting wire .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 71 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 magne@@ ts in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufacturing def@@ ect .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 13@@ ,000 am@@ ps suddenly encoun@@ tered electrical resistance .
this was the result .
now that &apos;s more im@@ pre@@ ssive when you consider those magne@@ ts wei@@ gh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the magne@@ ts .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tioned them all , fix@@ ed them .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be in@@ t@@ act again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in jun@@ e or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those acci@@ dents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to refu@@ te .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hu@@ mp@@ hre@@ y da@@ vy , who , i susp@@ ect , when defen@@ ding his prote@@ ge &apos;s u@@ sel@@ ess experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael f@@ ara@@ day -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteri@@ es in nature , that our tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
thank you .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gras@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relationships .
sp@@ ati@@ al reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this u@@ til@@ ity of our interac@@ tions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ e@@ van kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital fing@@ er@@ tip moving around a flat de@@ sk@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gras@@ p information physically ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
this question was so comp@@ el@@ ling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ f@@ tab@@ les .
in a nut@@ shel@@ l , a si@@ f@@ table is an interac@@ tive computer the size of a coo@@ ki@@ e .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wirel@@ ess radio .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gra@@ sp@@ ing .
and si@@ f@@ tab@@ les are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
and these interac@@ tive portra@@ its are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surr@@ ounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implic@@ ations on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday ge@@ stu@@ res on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might p@@ our a liqu@@ id .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ f@@ tab@@ les con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ckets and i can use them to p@@ our color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ sh@@ oot , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between sc@@ ra@@ bble and bo@@ g@@ gle .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dic@@ tionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of applic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instruc@@ tions .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
that &apos;s our youn@@ gest bet@@ a te@@ ster , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ f@@ tab@@ les up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interac@@ tive cartoon applic@@ ation .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is fel@@ i@@ x , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lif@@ ting the si@@ f@@ tab@@ les off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
video : the sun is ri@@ sing .
david mer@@ r@@ ill : now he &apos;s brought a trac@@ tor into the scene .
video : the oran@@ ge trac@@ tor .
good job ! yeah !
d@@ m : so by sha@@ king the si@@ f@@ tab@@ les and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- video : w@@ oof !
d@@ m : inven@@ ting his own narrative .
video : hel@@ lo !
d@@ m : it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story ,
and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
video : fly away , cat .
d@@ m : so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ encing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ f@@ tab@@ les act as sounds like lead , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
each of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can in@@ ject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemb@@ le into the pattern that you want .
and you in@@ ject it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ f@@ table against a sequence si@@ f@@ table . there are effects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and then , over@@ all effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
video : d@@ m : we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ f@@ tab@@ les , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
now i put a bas@@ s line in .
video : d@@ m : now i &apos;ll put some per@@ c@@ us@@ sion in .
video : d@@ m : and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
video : d@@ m : i can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the tempo one way or the other .
video : d@@ m : and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more expression .
video : d@@ m : i can re@@ ar@@ range the sequence while it pla@@ ys .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in advan@@ ce , but i can im@@ provi@@ se , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volume si@@ f@@ table , til@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the laboratory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for interac@@ ting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my profes@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation . and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work .
and the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this me@@ mo@@ ir called &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sens@@ ation , international be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler thing .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m doo@@ med .
seriously -- doo@@ med , doo@@ med !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all ,
ever again ? &quot;
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i was a teen@@ a@@ ger , when i first started telling people that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same sort of fe@@ ar-@@ based reaction .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mili@@ ation of re@@ jec@@ tion will kill you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ rap hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter as@@ h of failure ? &quot;
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things be@@ sides that people can &apos;t even guess at ,
like se@@ awe@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about lat@@ ely , and wondering about lat@@ ely ,
is why ? you know , is it rational ?
is it lo@@ gical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
and what is it specifically about creative ven@@ tures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
&quot; that chemic@@ al-@@ engineering block , john , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a repu@@ tation over the centu@@ ries for being alco@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ depressi@@ ves .
we writ@@ ers , we kind of do have that repu@@ tation ,
and not just writ@@ ers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this repu@@ tation for being enor@@ m@@ ously men@@ tally un@@ stable .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent creative minds
who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it su@@ ici@@ de seem to be really un@@ done by their gif@@ ts , you know .
nor@@ man ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said , &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
an extraordinary statement to make about your life &apos;s work .
but we don &apos;t even blin@@ k when we hear somebody say this ,
because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted collec@@ tively
this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ stry , in the end , will always ultimately lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that ?
because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assump@@ tion .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous ,
and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pe@@ tu@@ ated into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path
of assump@@ tion , particularly given the circum@@ stance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ a@@ k@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
so je@@ sus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drin@@ king g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning ,
and i don &apos;t want to go there .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of reflec@@ tion , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prote@@ c@@ tive psychological construc@@ t , right ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural an@@ x@@ iety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that ,
i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inher@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient rome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , ok ?
people believed that creativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some di@@ stant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble source , for di@@ stant and un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble reasons .
the gre@@ eks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ its of creativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
so@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
the roman@@ s had the same idea ,
but they called that sort of dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
which is great , because the roman@@ s did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly cle@@ ver individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gical di@@ v@@ ine en@@ tity , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio ,
kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f ,
and who would come out and sort of in@@ vi@@ si@@ bly assi@@ st the artist with their work
and would shape the outcome of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psychological construc@@ t to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it function@@ ed , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it ,
everybody knew that you had this dise@@ m@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
if your work bom@@ bed , not entirely your fa@@ ult , you know ?
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed ,
and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and mysteri@@ es ,
and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ st@@ ical creatures who take dict@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism ,
and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us , rather than having a geni@@ us .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge er@@ ror .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the fon@@ t and the essen@@ ce and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , un@@ kno@@ wa@@ ble , e@@ tern@@ al myster@@ y is just a s@@ mid@@ ge too much responsibility to put on one frag@@ ile , human psych@@ e .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able expect@@ ations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational hu@@ mani@@ stic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really le@@ giti@@ mate scientific susp@@ ici@@ ons about the notion of , basically , fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ bb@@ ing fair@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is --
you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the u@@ tter ma@@ dden@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ra@@ tionally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal . i had this encoun@@ ter recently
where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone ,
who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life
and she told me that when she was growing up in rural vir@@ gin@@ ia ,
she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet . she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil
fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough ,
so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house
and the poem would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem pas@@ ses through her ,
and she gra@@ bs a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her ,
and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was transcri@@ bing on the page .
and in these in@@ stances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pi@@ pel@@ ine !
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have bru@@ shed up against that thing , at times .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too . you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds ,
but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
and for me , the best con@@ temporary example that i have of how to do that is the musici@@ an tom wa@@ its ,
who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
and we were talking about this ,
and you know , tom , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ mented con@@ temporary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ control@@ la@@ ble creative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer ,
and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he &apos;s spe@@ eding along , and all of a sudden he he@@ ars this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy ,
that comes into his head as inspi@@ ration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tali@@ zing ,
and he wants it , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous ,
and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ cil , or a tape rec@@ order .
so he starts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ iety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stopped . he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; ex@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opport@@ un@@ e moment when i can take care of you .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
go bo@@ ther leon@@ ard co@@ hen . &quot; and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy an@@ x@@ iety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him
where it was cau@@ sing nothing but trouble , and released it back where it came from ,
and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ mented thing .
it could be this pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ d@@ rou@@ s , biz@@ ar@@ re collaboration , kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite tom .
when i heard that story , it started to shift a little bit
the way that i worked too , and this idea already saved me once .
it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pra@@ y , love , &quot;
and i fell into one of those sort of p@@ its of desp@@ air
that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
but then i reme@@ mber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just lif@@ ted my face up from the manu@@ script and i direc@@ ted my com@@ ments to an empty corner of the room .
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fa@@ ult , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this ,
i don &apos;t have any more than this .
if you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and i would please like the record to reflec@@ t today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
because -- because in the end it &apos;s like this , ok --
centu@@ ries ago in the deser@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of sac@@ red dance and music
that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
they were always ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent , because the dan@@ c@@ ers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
but every once in a while , very rar@@ ely , something would happen ,
and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become trans@@ cen@@ dent .
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life ,
a performance like this . it was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of por@@ tal
and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would ali@@ g@@ n .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
he would be l@@ it from within , and l@@ it from below
and all l@@ it up on fire with di@@ vin@@ ity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name . they would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note : when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern sp@@ ain , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them
and the p@@ ron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centu@@ ries from &quot; al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; ol@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot;
which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ amen@@ co dan@@ ces .
in sp@@ ain , when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic , &quot; al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , al@@ la@@ h , ma@@ gni@@ fic@@ ent , bra@@ vo , &quot;
in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and discover@@ s that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a.@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
and maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins ,
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish
if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspec@@ ts of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life
to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way , it starts to change everything .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think ,
and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published ,
as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ cip@@ ated follow up
to my fre@@ a@@ k@@ ish success . and what i have to sort of keep telling myself when i get really psych@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the di@@ v@@ ine , co@@ cke@@ yed geni@@ us as@@ signed to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your effor@@ ts , then &quot; ol@@ é ! &quot;
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and &quot; ol@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
&quot; ol@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
jun@@ e co@@ hen : ol@@ é !
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and discover@@ ing new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ giti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new pha@@ se of biology with designing and synthe@@ si@@ zing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many biolo@@ gists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various approach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to minim@@ al compon@@ ents .
we &apos;ve been di@@ giti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ;
when we sequ@@ enced the human genome , it was going from the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
this is the map of a small organis@@ m , my@@ cop@@ la@@ sm@@ a gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the sm@@ alle@@ st genome for a species that can self-@@ replic@@ ate in the laboratory ,
and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its metaboli@@ c map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours --
trust me , this is simple --
but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthe@@ size this chromos@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we synthe@@ size a chromos@@ ome ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromos@@ ome ?
a chromos@@ ome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our p@@ ace of di@@ giti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing ,
and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several sta@@ ges , in fact , starting with a bi@@ oe@@ th@@ ical revie@@ w before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out synthe@@ si@@ zing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the err@@ ors .
and this was our first at@@ tempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kil@@ ls bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror correc@@ tion
and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting pha@@ se came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vir@@ al particles .
the vir@@ al particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger :
we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chromos@@ ome --
it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code --
so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ asse@@ tt@@ es
to understand what the actual compon@@ ents of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequ@@ enced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accur@@ acy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pa@@ irs .
we actually found , on rese@@ qu@@ encing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be boo@@ ted up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
tri@@ ple@@ ts of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o ac@@ ids , such that there &apos;s a single letter desig@@ nation for each of the amin@@ o ac@@ ids .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , senten@@ ces , thoughts .
ini@@ tially , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ pointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes ;
there are enz@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 24@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robu@@ st that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball play@@ off .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pa@@ irs , they won &apos;t any longer grow rea@@ di@@ ly in e@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology --
and so we turned to other mechanis@@ ms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechanism called hom@@ olo@@ g@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it :
there &apos;s an organis@@ m called de@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromos@@ ome just gets blo@@ wn apart .
tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally de@@ sic@@ c@@ ated ;
they can live in a vacu@@ um .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using yea@@ st mechanis@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ;
yea@@ st puts them together automati@@ cally .
this is not an electro@@ n micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular pho@@ tom@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light micros@@ cope .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
so , this is the public@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ;
it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we boot up a chromos@@ ome ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ;
it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also si@@ m@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nu@@ cle@@ us and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ oning .
with bacteria and arch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the chromos@@ ome is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete transp@@ l@@ ant of a chromos@@ ome from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromos@@ ome from one microbi@@ al species --
roughly , these two are as di@@ stant as human and m@@ ice --
we added a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromos@@ ome ,
we di@@ ge@@ sted it with enz@@ y@@ mes to kill all the prote@@ ins ,
and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisticated graph@@ ics here . the new chromos@@ ome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechanism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromos@@ ome or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
there are enz@@ y@@ mes called restri@@ ction enz@@ y@@ mes that actually di@@ gest dna .
the chromos@@ ome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ;
the chromos@@ ome we put in does .
it got ex@@ pressed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromos@@ ome as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromos@@ ome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the character@@ ist@@ ics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the prote@@ ins changed , the me@@ m@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ che@@ my , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite drama@@ tically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution . and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian expl@@ osi@@ on , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet
for every one of us that exist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medic@@ ines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 bil@@ li@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil --
that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future .
the electron@@ ics industry only had a dozen or so compon@@ ents , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rap@@ id metho@@ ds of synthe@@ sis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromos@@ om@@ es a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to optimi@@ ze processes to produce o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or to produce ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tic@@ als , new vacc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard selec@@ tion :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen sn@@ ap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like :
we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
you &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
we have secon@@ d@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fu@@ els like o@@ ct@@ an@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road . and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
sun@@ light and co2 is one method ... but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
this is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
it takes co2 to me@@ than@@ e using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , conver@@ t that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have mo@@ dest goals of replac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ chemical industry --
yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? --
become a major source of energy ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant sets of vacc@@ ines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vacc@@ ines in advan@@ ce .
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with synthe@@ tic bacteria , arch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ yo@@ tes .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people :
our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some found@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an ac@@ qui@@ si@@ tion almost exactly a year ago .
this is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either loc@@ ally or remo@@ tely interact with vast amoun@@ ts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zoo@@ ming in , pan@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment .
it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is &quot; b@@ lea@@ k house &quot; by dic@@ kens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real represen@@ tation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ mend it .
this is a more reali@@ stic case , an issue of the guar@@ dian .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an inher@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we &apos;ve done something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ dian .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high re@@ solution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specific@@ ations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real est@@ ate .
we hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ bb@@ ish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , m@@ apping is one of those obvious applic@@ ations for a technology like this . and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer@@ -@@ vision research done by no@@ ah sna@@ vely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve se@@ it@@ z at u.@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ zel@@ is@@ ki at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
you can see that when we do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ re@@ solution experience .
but the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ gement of the images here is actually meaningful .
the computer vision algorithms have regi@@ ster@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respond to the real space in which these sho@@ ts -- all taken near gra@@ ss@@ i la@@ kes in the can@@ a@@ dian ro@@ c@@ kies -- all these sho@@ ts were taken . so you see elements here of st@@ abili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind the pho@@ t@@ osy@@ n@@ th technology , it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of no@@ tr@@ e dame ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done entirely compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally from images sc@@ rap@@ ed from f@@ lic@@ k@@ r . you just type no@@ tr@@ e dame into f@@ lic@@ k@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the campus and so on .
and each of these oran@@ ge con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
and so these are all f@@ lic@@ k@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
we can just navi@@ gate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
it &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ fying to have this kind of recep@@ tion here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cel@@ l-@@ phone cameras to professional sl@@ r@@ s , quite a large number of them , st@@ it@@ ched together in this environment .
if i can find some of the sort of weird ones --
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there is actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a poster of no@@ tr@@ e dame that regi@@ ster@@ ed correc@@ tly .
we can di@@ ve in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
those photos become lin@@ ked , and they make something emer@@ gent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emer@@ ges of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to stephen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting ta@@ gged with meta@@ -@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of no@@ tr@@ e dame ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that meta@@ -@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cros@@ s-@@ mo@@ d@@ al and cros@@ s-@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ mensel@@ y rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
chris anderson : do i understand this right ? what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together ?
ba@@ a : yes . what this is really doing is discover@@ ing ,
creating hyper@@ links , if you will , between images .
it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the se@@ man@@ tic information a lot of images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in phra@@ ses , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information
about what that picture is of .
what if that picture links to all of your pictures ? the amount of se@@ man@@ tic inter@@ connection and rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
ca : truly incredible . con@@ grat@@ ula@@ tions .
you know , one of the intense plea@@ su@@ res of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
just to know that ja@@ gu@@ ar sha@@ man@@ s still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ uit elders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya , the bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthrop@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality ,
the consequ@@ ence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ ea@@ ge made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives . we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation rit@@ es .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death ,
so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the forests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the v@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in ha@@ iti , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the ka@@ is@@ ut desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the and@@ es , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ er@@ ai in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ den@@ tally the fellow that i travel@@ ed into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the slop@@ es of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma ,
ever@@ est , the god@@ de@@ ss mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ en@@ ting yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritu@@ al life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here ,
and you might define the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intui@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the da@@ wn of consciousness .
the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
it &apos;s the symbo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an aston@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qui@@ si@@ tive species .
and just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biolo@@ gists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of extin@@ ction because it simply is not true ,
and yet that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic scenario scar@@ cel@@ y approach@@ es what we know to be the most optimi@@ stic scenario in the real@@ m of cultural diversity .
and the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of voca@@ bul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
a language is a fla@@ sh of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritu@@ al possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in monter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being whi@@ sp@@ ered into the e@@ ars of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies ,
which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ance@@ stors or anti@@ cip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and carri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last syl@@ la@@ b@@ les of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it can@@ ton@@ ese .
let &apos;s make it ko@@ g@@ i . &quot; and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a brief journey through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olo@@ g@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sna@@ kes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the hea@@ vens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest upon which the people dep@@ end .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; ling@@ ui@@ stic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
and this is all roo@@ ted in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone practic@@ ing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ oran@@ i of nor@@ the@@ aster@@ n ecu@@ ad@@ or , an aston@@ ishing people first contac@@ ted peac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries at@@ temp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 g@@ los@@ sy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly ge@@ stu@@ res , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure ,
found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they spe@@ ared the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but the wa@@ oran@@ i didn &apos;t just spea@@ r out@@ si@@ ders . they spe@@ ared each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ aring each other .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two in@@ stances of natural death
and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ared him anyway . but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was aston@@ ishing .
their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really aston@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to ha@@ iti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s strength and t@@ ont@@ on mac@@ ou@@ tes , and secur@@ ing the po@@ ison used to make zom@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sens@@ ation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and v@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sical world@@ view . it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam , bu@@ dd@@ hi@@ sm , ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assump@@ tion being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious belie@@ fs . well , of course , they did
and v@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the di@@ stil@@ lation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic dia@@ spor@@ a of the sla@@ very era .
but , what makes v@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
the spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance to momen@@ tar@@ ily disp@@ l@@ ace the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that brief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ oly@@ te becomes the god .
that &apos;s why the v@@ ood@@ oo@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot; and because you are pos@@ se@@ ssed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these aston@@ ishing demonstra@@ tions : v@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ oly@@ tes in a state of tran@@ ce hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with im@@ pun@@ ity ,
a rather aston@@ ishing demonstra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the ko@@ g@@ i of the sier@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada de san@@ ta mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
de@@ scen@@ dan@@ ts of the ancient ta@@ iron@@ a civilization which once car@@ pe@@ ted the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est ,
these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic ma@@ ssi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pla@@ in .
in a bloo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the span@@ ish .
to this day , they remain ru@@ led by a ritu@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ oly@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four ,
se@@ que@@ ster@@ ed in a sha@@ dow@@ y world of dar@@ kness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glac@@ i@@ ers for 18 years :
two nin@@ e-@@ year perio@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to mi@@ mic the nine months of gest@@ ation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ;
now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cultur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ yers and their pra@@ yers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the ecolo@@ gical -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ stal moment of awareness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the slop@@ es of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract is af@@ fir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back
and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is y@@ ours to protect . &quot; they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot;
and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of intui@@ tion becomes very important .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke rou@@ s@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ va@@ ge , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity ,
or altern@@ ati@@ vely , we in@@ vo@@ ke th@@ or@@ ea@@ u and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther sen@@ ti@@ mental nor wea@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al swa@@ mp@@ s of the as@@ m@@ at or in the chil@@ ling win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ sti@@ que of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intui@@ tion : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ? it means that a young kid from the and@@ es who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her de@@ stin@@ y will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mont@@ ana raised to believe that a mountain is a p@@ ile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a p@@ ile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was raised in the forests of british colum@@ bia to believe those forests exist@@ ed to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the kwa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cr@@ oo@@ ked be@@ ak of hea@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ bal spir@@ its that d@@ wel@@ led at the north end of the world ,
spir@@ its they would have to engage during their ha@@ mat@@ sa initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discover@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west amazon just last ap@@ ri@@ l .
this is a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
what makes a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er ph@@ arm@@ ac@@ ological potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources :
on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of beta@@ -@@ car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallucin@@ ogen@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness --
but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called psycho@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ o@@ ton@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ stance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains metho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your nose is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electricity . it doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the di@@ ss@@ ol@@ u@@ tion of reality .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard e@@ van sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who spar@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ del@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mu@@ sh@@ rooms in mexico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s --
i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallucin@@ ogen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation . but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found naturally in the human gu@@ t called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ da@@ se .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating things are that the beta@@ -@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the preci@@ se sort necessary to poten@@ ti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question . how , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cu@@ lar plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olo@@ g@@ ically un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot; well , what does that mean ? this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 var@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ ya@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they estab@@ lish their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 var@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qua@@ int and color@@ ful but somehow reduc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be reme@@ mber@@ ed for its wars or its technological innov@@ ations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either acti@@ vely en@@ dor@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the si@@ ou@@ x indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ g@@ gy .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here . it is power ,
the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
wher@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures de@@ st@@ ined to fa@@ de away ;
these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to ad@@ apt to :
whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ forest@@ ation in the hom@@ eland of the pen@@ an -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been reduc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ iled with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters hang light in the horizon
ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest --
or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
you know , genocide , the physical extin@@ ction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once travel@@ led 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ aster@@ n ti@@ bet to l@@ ha@@ sa
with a young collea@@ gue , and it was only when i got to l@@ ha@@ sa that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about :
6@@ ,000 sac@@ red monu@@ ments tor@@ n apart to du@@ st and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the c@@ ad@@ res during the cultural revolution .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
that meant he was instan@@ tly killed at the time of the chinese inva@@ sion .
his un@@ cle f@@ led with his hol@@ iness in the dia@@ spor@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led into the ja@@ il at the age of two to hide bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that bra@@ ve deed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ ten@@ tly ste@@ pped on an ar@@ mb@@ and of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gre@@ ssion , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice :
do we want to live in a mon@@ och@@ ro@@ matic world of mon@@ o@@ ton@@ y or do we want to embr@@ ace a poly@@ chro@@ matic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et me@@ ad , the great anthrop@@ ologist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ p@@ hou@@ s gen@@ eric world view
not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination reduc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mo@@ d@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hu@@ mb@@ ling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 50,000 &#93; years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ m@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the seed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was disp@@ lac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we created hier@@ arch@@ y speciali@@ zation sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing millen@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ dens find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is a photograph i took at the northern tip of b@@ aff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ uit people ,
and this man , ol@@ a@@ y@@ uk , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ a@@ dian government has not always been kind to the in@@ uit people , and during the 19@@ 50@@ s , to estab@@ lish our s@@ over@@ eig@@ n@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ le@@ ments .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father refu@@ sed to go .
the family , fe@@ ar@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in@@ uit did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ apped in car@@ ib@@ ou hide .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ sers and de@@ fec@@ ated into his hand . and as the fec@@ es began to free@@ ze , he shaped it into the form of a bla@@ de .
he put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ va on the edge of the sh@@ it kni@@ fe
and as it finally fro@@ ze so@@ lid , he bu@@ t@@ ch@@ ered a dog with it .
he s@@ kin@@ ned the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness ,
took the ri@@ b@@ ca@@ ge of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sle@@ d ,
har@@ ne@@ ssed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and dis@@ appeared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it kni@@ fe in belt .
talk about getting by with nothing . and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbo@@ l of the resi@@ li@@ ence of the in@@ uit people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
the can@@ a@@ dian government in ap@@ ri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ uit an area of land larger than california and texas put together . it &apos;s our new hom@@ eland . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent terr@@ it@@ ory . they control all miner@@ al resources .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek re@@ stitu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve travel@@ ed in these remote reach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the da@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked geo@@ graphy of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geo@@ graphic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ comp@@ lish anything .
we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s -- -- we think that po@@ le@@ mic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ a@@ sive , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institu@@ tion in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month . 15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel . our magaz@@ ines are read by millions .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthrop@@ ology : that this world deser@@ ves to exist in a diverse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly mul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ ali@@ stic world
where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine
that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard ,
and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you mis@@ sed them .
but i want to start with what i call the &quot; offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ? the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the way to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze freedom is to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have ,
and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t oc@@ c@@ ur to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super@@ market .
not such a big one . i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic vin@@ eg@@ ars you could buy
to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the consumer electron@@ ics store to set up a stere@@ o system -- spea@@ kers , c@@ d player , tape player , tun@@ er , amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er --
and in this one single consumer electron@@ ics store , there are that many stere@@ o systems .
we can construc@@ t si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different stere@@ o systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on offer in one store .
you &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you ren@@ ted your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones ,
especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , nose hair tri@@ mmer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon , you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspec@@ ts of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same expl@@ osi@@ on of choice is true .
health care . it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; doc , what should i do ? &quot;
and the doc says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
and the doc says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot;
which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for deci@@ sion@@ -@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient . there &apos;s enormous marketing of pre@@ scrip@@ tion drugs
to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pre@@ scrip@@ tions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate .
we don &apos;t inher@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family ,
there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ult assump@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
no@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for gra@@ bs .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves ,
&quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ? should i get married later ?
should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are consu@@ ming questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are ble@@ ssed , as car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that enab@@ les us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the ran@@ dol@@ p@@ h hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ fi actually works .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blac@@ k@@ ber@@ ry on our other hip , and our laptop , pre@@ su@@ ma@@ bly , on our l@@ aps .
and even if they &apos;re all shu@@ t off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i dra@@ ft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and life@@ style things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
&#91; well , actually , they are written in stone . &#93; that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this . &#91; the ten comm@@ and@@ ments dy@@ i k@@ it &#93;
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , parado@@ xic@@ ally , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many op@@ tions to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;ll give you one very dramatic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ rement pl@@ ans .
a collea@@ gue of mine got access to investment records from van@@ gu@@ ard , the gigan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al-@@ fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emplo@@ yer off@@ ered , rate of particip@@ ation went down two percent .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow . and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow ,
and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the emplo@@ yer .
by not particip@@ ating , they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year
from the emplo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
so par@@ al@@ ys@@ is is a consequ@@ ence of having too many choices . and i think it makes the world look like this .
&#91; and la@@ stly , for all e@@ tern@@ ity , french , ble@@ u che@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93;
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ tern@@ ity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fund , or the wrong sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ ys@@ is and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer op@@ tions to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dre@@ ss@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad dre@@ ssing is ? --
it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better .
and what happens is this imag@@ ined alternative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gr@@ et the decision you made ,
and this re@@ gr@@ et sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more op@@ tions there are , the easier it is to re@@ gr@@ et anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you chose .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
dan gil@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of altern@@ atives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attrac@@ tive fe@@ atures of altern@@ atives that you re@@ ject
that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
here &apos;s an example . &#91; i can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on w 8@@ 5@@ th street &#93; sorry if you &apos;re not new yor@@ kers .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ha@@ mp@@ tons .
very expensive real est@@ ate .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking ,
&quot; it &apos;s augu@@ st . everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks na@@ gged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tr@@ act from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the more op@@ tions there are to consider , the more attrac@@ tive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions
are going to be reflec@@ ted by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have lots of attrac@@ tive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attrac@@ tive .
third : es@@ cal@@ ation of expect@@ ations .
this hit me when i went to replace my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fla@@ vor , and you bought them , and they fit like cra@@ p , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , if you wor@@ e them and wa@@ shed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
i went to replace my je@@ ans after years of wearing these old ones ,
and i said , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the shop@@ keep@@ er said , &quot; do you want slim fit , easy fit , rel@@ ax@@ ed fit ?
you want bu@@ tton fly or zi@@ p@@ per fly ? you want st@@ on@@ e@@ wa@@ shed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wa@@ shed ?
do you want them di@@ stre@@ ssed ?
you want boot cut , tap@@ ered , bla@@ h bla@@ h . &quot; on and on he went .
my ja@@ w dro@@ pped . and after i rec@@ overed , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans ,
and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the be@@ st-@@ fit@@ ting je@@ ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but -- i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason -- the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my expect@@ ations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
i had very low , no particular expect@@ ations when they only came in one fla@@ vor .
when they came in 100 fla@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what i expected .
ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expect@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this .
&#91; it all looks so great . i can &apos;t wait to be dis@@ ap@@ pointed . &#93; because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
&#91; everything was better back when everything was worse &#93;
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a ple@@ as@@ ant surprise .
no@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perfec@@ tion the expect@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be ple@@ as@@ antly surprised because your expect@@ ations , my expect@@ ations ,
have gone through the roof . the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expect@@ ations .
&#91; you &apos;ll do &#93; i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better .
i didn &apos;t sett@@ le .
but sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing . finally -- one consequ@@ ence of buying a bad@@ -@@ fit@@ ting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are di@@ ss@@ ati@@ s@@ fied , and you ask why ,
who &apos;s responsible ,
the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on disp@@ lay , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ pointed about them ;
they bl@@ ame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this expl@@ osi@@ on of depression , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ards are so high ,
and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ult .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objec@@ tively , and we feel worse .
so let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se .
it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some ma@@ gical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where op@@ tions improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this :
what enab@@ les all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice . their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
and what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve le@@ vit@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help . they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enab@@ les people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved ,
but ours would be impro@@ ved also ,
which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ e@@ to-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pla@@ gues us .
so to conclu@@ de . &#91; you can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93; you &apos;re supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have par@@ al@@ ys@@ is .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
you increase par@@ al@@ ys@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the ab@@ sen@@ ce of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i susp@@ ect , disaster .
thank you very much .
several years ago here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge
called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple : teams of four have to build the tal@@ le@@ st fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 stic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti , one y@@ ard of tape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i &apos;ve conduc@@ ted about 70 design work@@ shop@@ s across the world with students and designers and architec@@ ts , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortun@@ e 50 ,
and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by ori@@ en@@ ting themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ c@@ key for power .
then they spend some time planning , organi@@ zing ,
they s@@ ket@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti .
they spend the majority of their time assemb@@ ling the stic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
and then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! --
they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collap@@ se .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others ,
and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get di@@ str@@ ac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures ,
and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kinder@@ gar@@ ten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tal@@ le@@ st structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be ceo of sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti , in@@ c . right ?
they don &apos;t spend time jo@@ cke@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they execu@@ te on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently
is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low ,
and they build proto@@ types , succes@@ sive proto@@ types ,
always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build proto@@ types along the way .
designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essen@@ ce of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get inst@@ ant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential ,
but let &apos;s look at how different teams perform .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ;
business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that ,
kinder@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architec@@ ts and engineers , than@@ k@@ fully .
thir@@ ty-@@ nine in@@ ches is the tal@@ le@@ st structure i &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ ang@@ les and self-@@ re@@ in@@ for@@ cing geome@@ trical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average ,
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting . if you put you put an execu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of fac@@ il@@ itation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who mana@@ ges and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
speci@@ alized skills and fac@@ il@@ itation skills are the combination that leads to strong success .
if you have 10 teams that typically perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened :
not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t that interesting ? that high sta@@ kes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of proto@@ typ@@ ing .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tal@@ le@@ st structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of in@@ centi@@ ves and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help teams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assump@@ tions .
because , fran@@ kly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ w@@ challen@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
there &apos;s ste@@ p-@@ b@@ y-@@ step instruc@@ tions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people twe@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
there &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine . a big machine , a cool , ted-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot lat@@ ely and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were autom@@ o@@ bi@@ les or twitter or &quot; american i@@ dol . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that cro@@ wd , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous . it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet ,
they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents pu@@ shed that number to 70 .
my parents are clos@@ ing in on 80 .
so there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us ,
because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
it re@@ shaped the demo@@ graphy of the glo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ aten@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ bel@@ la , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vacc@@ ines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h@@ s of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times . and one of them is that despite all our ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
that number &apos;s ri@@ sing , and it &apos;s ri@@ sing really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tra@@ sh this glo@@ be .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innov@@ ate our way out of this me@@ ss , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that keep@@ s me up at night :
we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never . and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields ,
and yet i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we bat@@ t@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now . people w@@ rap themselves in their belie@@ fs ,
and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free . not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s en@@ tit@@ led to their opini@@ on ; they &apos;re even en@@ tit@@ led to their opini@@ on about progress . but you know what you &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to ?
you &apos;re not en@@ tit@@ led to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for the new yor@@ ker . a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do : i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engineer@@ ed food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ foo@@ ds , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tre@@ sp@@ as@@ sing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on . i mean , i &apos;m a journalist . we type , we file , we go to dinner . it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that &apos;s because those fan@@ ati@@ cs that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ ati@@ cs at all .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , de@@ cent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just di@@ stur@@ bed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest . we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic terms with little quo@@ tes around it :
&quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challen@@ ger , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right ,
so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence . don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epidemic of autism to the meas@@ les , mu@@ mp@@ s and ru@@ bel@@ la vaccine shot .
very sc@@ ary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ do@@ tes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of docu@@ ments from a government offici@@ al giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s . disa@@ st@@ rou@@ s because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful , and we should be as@@ ha@@ med of ourselves .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jen@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing messages of fear and il@@ liter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; op@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; lar@@ ry king live . &quot;
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link cau@@ s@@ ation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ ony . polio -- pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off@@ it .
he just developed a ro@@ ta@@ virus vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 50@@ 0,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valuable they are
and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terrori@@ st .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t te@@ sti@@ fy without arm@@ ed gu@@ ards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horri@@ ble diseases . and that &apos;s happening .
we have meas@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little stri@@ dent .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccin@@ ate her kid against polio ,
no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in la@@ gos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to atten@@ d one of these fa@@ bul@@ ous ted din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a par@@ aly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to w@@ rap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medic@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re u@@ sel@@ ess .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ? i &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ? well , i think i understand , we hate big ph@@ ar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
and we shouldn &apos;t : our health care system suc@@ ks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely aston@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fra@@ u@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fra@@ u@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fra@@ u@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of h@@ h@@ s who &apos;s saying , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammo@@ gra@@ ms , &quot;
or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee ene@@ mas .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
he killed 40@@ 0,000 of his people by insi@@ sting that bee@@ tr@@ oot , gar@@ lic and le@@ mon oil were much more effective than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pla@@ gu@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most mind@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d battle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engineer@@ ed food and the organic elite .
it &apos;s an idi@@ o@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaph@@ ors .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ sle@@ y , every bru@@ s@@ sels spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the garden of e@@ den .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more preci@@ se way --
and there are risks , absolutely --
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in a into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we object to gene@@ tically engineer@@ ed food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , pe@@ stic@@ id@@ es , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ en@@ ting life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning se@@ eds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s patent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t ,
but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s preven@@ ting millions of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now ,
70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful . dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? gene@@ tically engineer@@ ed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that ro@@ tten stuff , like cas@@ sa@@ va for instance .
cas@@ sa@@ va &apos;s something that half a billion people eat . it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it suc@@ ks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our insi@@ st@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
this isn &apos;t about ri@@ ce kri@@ sp@@ ies , this is about keeping people alive ,
and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these convers@@ ations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you . thank you . thank you .
one day , los angeles times colum@@ ni@@ st
steve lop@@ e@@ z was walking along
the streets of down@@ town los angeles
when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man ,
an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man ,
char@@ ming , rug@@ ged , hom@@ eless ,
playing a viol@@ in that only had two str@@ ings .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know ,
because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis
for a book , which was turned into a movie ,
with robert dow@@ ney j@@ r@@ . acting as steve lop@@ e@@ z ,
and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel an@@ th@@ ony a@@ yers ,
the ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bas@@ si@@ st
whose promis@@ ing career was cut short
by a tra@@ gic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel dro@@ pped out of ju@@ il@@ li@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down ,
and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless
on the streets of sk@@ id row in down@@ town los angeles .
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie
to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond
that formed between these two men ,
but how music helped shape that b@@ ond ,
and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the pu@@ n --
in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
i met mr. a@@ yers in 2008 ,
two years ago , at wal@@ t di@@ sne@@ y conc@@ ert hall .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth symp@@ hon@@ ies ,
and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way
about y@@ o-@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton
and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series ,
all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first viol@@ in passa@@ ge work
in the last movement of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth symp@@ hon@@ y .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later
saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a viol@@ in lesson with me .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel refu@@ ses treatment
because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy
and th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s ,
and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
but as a result now , he is pr@@ one to
these schi@@ z@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ iso@@ des ,
the worst of which can manife@@ st themselves as
him explo@@ ding
and then dis@@ appe@@ aring for days ,
w@@ ander@@ ing the streets of sk@@ id row ,
ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind
un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation
when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t di@@ sne@@ y conc@@ ert hall --
he had a kind of mani@@ c g@@ lin@@ t in his eyes ,
he was lost .
and he was talking about
invisible dem@@ ons and smo@@ ke ,
and how someone was po@@ is@@ oning him in his sleep .
and i was afraid ,
not for myself , but i was afraid
that i was going to lose him ,
that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states ,
and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the viol@@ in
if i started talking about sc@@ ales
and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of
di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic viol@@ in pe@@ da@@ go@@ gy .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven viol@@ in concer@@ to .
and as i played ,
i understood that there was a profound change
occur@@ ring in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tical ,
a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music
was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s mani@@ c ra@@ ge
was trans@@ formed into understanding ,
a qui@@ et curi@@ osity and gr@@ ace .
and in a mi@@ rac@@ le , he lif@@ ted his own viol@@ in
and he started playing , by ear ,
certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of viol@@ in concer@@ to@@ s
which he then asked me to complete -- men@@ del@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n ,
t@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ bel@@ i@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach
to bee@@ tho@@ ven and bra@@ h@@ ms ,
bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s ,
from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to e@@ sa@@ -@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ onen .
and i understood that he not only
had an en@@ cycl@@ op@@ edi@@ c knowledge of music ,
but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion
and understanding that i share with my colleagues
in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music ,
this man had trans@@ formed
from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , di@@ stur@@ bed man
that had just come from walking the streets
of down@@ town los angeles
to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te ,
brilliant , ju@@ il@@ li@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musici@@ an .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts
and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them
through his imagination and his creativity ,
into reality .
and that is an es@@ cape
from his tor@@ mented state .
and i understood that this was the very essen@@ ce of art .
this was the very reason why we made music ,
that we take something that exists within all of us
at our very fundamental core ,
our emotions ,
and through our arti@@ stic lens ,
through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression
reach@@ es all of us
and moves us , inspi@@ res and un@@ ites us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel ,
music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back
into a family of musici@@ ans
that understood him ,
that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents
and respec@@ ted him .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel ,
whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t di@@ sne@@ y conc@@ ert hall
or on sk@@ id row , because he re@@ minds me
why i became a musici@@ an .
thank you .
brun@@ o gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : thank you . thanks .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta .
robert gu@@ p@@ ta : i &apos;m going to play something that i sha@@ mel@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from cel@@ li@@ sts .
so , please for@@ give me .
i &apos;m jane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years ,
and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it en@@ ta@@ ils convin@@ cing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , consi@@ dering how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total drama@@ tically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ -@@ intui@@ tive idea , so i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in :
if we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , o@@ bes@@ ity , i believe that we need to asp@@ ire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade . no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portra@@ it by photo@@ grapher phi@@ l to@@ le@@ dan@@ o .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing ,
so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fear , but intense concentra@@ tion , deep , deep focus on tac@@ k@@ ling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ ink@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m ,
and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; ep@@ ic win . &quot;
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that .
ok , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an ep@@ ic win is an outcome that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achie@@ ved it .
it was almost beyond the thre@@ sh@@ old of imagination , and when you get there ,
you &apos;re sho@@ cked to discover what you &apos;re truly capable of . that &apos;s an ep@@ ic win .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m-@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to tac@@ k@@ le the ob@@ stac@@ les of the next century --
the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tac@@ k@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ iti in my old neighborhood in ber@@ kel@@ ey , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters -- inspired to collabor@@ ate and to cooper@@ ate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds , i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice ,
the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confron@@ t ob@@ stac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med ,
we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe de@@ pressed , frustr@@ ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games ,
they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real-@@ world work ?
so i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative proble@@ m-@@ solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make ep@@ ic win@@ s so possible in online worlds .
the first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game .
right ? so you can do it .
they never give you a challenge you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .
but there &apos;s no un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment in world of war@@ craft ; no sitting around ,
wr@@ inging your hands --
there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your ep@@ ic mission .
that &apos;s not something we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and there &apos;s this ep@@ ic story , this inspir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing ,
and we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage , i &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an ep@@ ic win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , collec@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of a@@ zer@@ o@@ th .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ liest pri@@ mate human ance@@ stors stood up .
that was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently inve@@ sting in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also apt , because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and he@@ ar@@ ty species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ;
it was recently published by a research@@ er at car@@ ne@@ gie mel@@ l@@ on university :
the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school , from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation , if you have perfect atten@@ dance .
so , we have an entire parallel track of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
some of you have probably read mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; out@@ li@@ ers , &quot;
so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cogni@@ ti@@ ve-@@ science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effor@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ os@@ os at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ prece@@ den@@ ted human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtu@@ os@@ o gam@@ ers ,
500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
and in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ so@@ les that are low-@@ energy and that work with the wirel@@ ess phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet , so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , brazil , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
so i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ os@@ os at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
ok , think of this as extreme self-@@ motiv@@ ation .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to tac@@ k@@ le an ob@@ stac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an ep@@ ic win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ os@@ os at wea@@ ving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us bad@@ ly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and cooper@@ ation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity . i love it .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er pla@@ ys for 22 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ ax@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
we know that we are optimi@@ zed as human beings , to do hard and meaningful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally : ep@@ ic meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to awe@@ -@@ inspir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective :
so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ iled more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they are building an ep@@ ic story .
they are building an ep@@ ic knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing :
gam@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ powered hop@@ eful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there &apos;s an econom@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ stron@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are inve@@ sting so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ ne@@ ssing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mass ex@@ o@@ dus to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s rational .
and he says -- not like me , i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life ;
they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
we have to start making the real world work more like a game .
i take my inspi@@ ration from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
before we had awesome game control@@ lers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings ,
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian hero@@ do@@ tus , you might know this history ,
which is the history of who invented games and why .
hero@@ do@@ tus says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia , during a time of fam@@ ine .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of ly@@ dia decided they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to hero@@ do@@ tus , they invented di@@ ce games , and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy :
on one day , everybody would eat ,
and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games , because games are so enga@@ ging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying , bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games ;
and on the next day , they would eat .
and according to hero@@ do@@ tus , they passed 18 years this way ,
survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today . we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape real-@@ world suffering --
we &apos;re using games to get away
from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to hero@@ do@@ tus , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better ,
so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
they divi@@ ded the entire king@@ dom in half .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an ep@@ ic ad@@ venture .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live ,
leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tru@@ sc@@ ans , who then led to the ro@@ man empi@@ re , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have sugge@@ sted that hero@@ do@@ tus &apos; crazy story is actually true .
and ge@@ ologists have found evidence of a global coo@@ ling that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years , that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
so this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
that was the first real-@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own ep@@ ic game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world ,
so that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of ga@@ me-@@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real-@@ world problems .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real-@@ world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve de@@ vo@@ ted my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it ex@@ pre@@ sses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the be@@ st-@@ case scenario outcome ,
and then we want to em@@ power people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine ep@@ ic win@@ s , and then give people the means to achieve the ep@@ ic win .
i &apos;m just going to very brief@@ ly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an at@@ tempt to give people the means to create ep@@ ic win@@ s in their own fu@@ tures .
this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ tage .
the oil shor@@ tage is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so when you come to the game , you sign up , tell us where you live ,
and then we give you real-@@ time news videos , data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transpor@@ tation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there &apos;s ri@@ o@@ ting ,
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pil@@ o@@ ted this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 ,
and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a transforma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
but if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an ep@@ ic ad@@ venture and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and ad@@ venture for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot;
most of our players have kept up the ha@@ bits that they learned in this game .
so for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to a@@ im higher -- bigger problem than just pe@@ ak oil .
we did a game called super@@ struc@@ t at the institute for the future .
and the pre@@ mise was , a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the global extin@@ ction awareness system , of course .
we asked people to come online -- almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ heimer movie .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ heimer movies , you form a dream team --
you &apos;ve got the astron@@ au@@ t , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , google &quot; super@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the world bank institute as a social innov@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with univer@@ si@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphic novel , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in skills like local insight , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness .
i would like to inv@@ ite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pri@@ ses to save the world .
so , i &apos;m going to w@@ rap up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ o@@ ts of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do real-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ powers : bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to wea@@ ve a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m and the desire for ep@@ ic meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
that &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want , so i say :
let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ,
which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot; in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a measu@@ ra@@ ble effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ,
just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tical or some sort of a --
for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measu@@ ra@@ ble effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a ru@@ dimen@@ t@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 19@@ 50@@ s .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i expla@@ ined it .
so , here &apos;s what happens .
the kni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
i &apos;m just going to hold the kni@@ fe in my fi@@ st like this .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i &apos;m just going to s@@ que@@ e@@ ze my w@@ ri@@ st right here .
that way you can see that at no time
can anything travel , as long as i &apos;m s@@ que@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the kni@@ fe .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can shake it , and the kni@@ fe does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tric@@ ker@@ y . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about de@@ cep@@ tion by studying
this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ do@@ log@@ ically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the kni@@ fe in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my w@@ ri@@ st to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve ,
that is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my w@@ ri@@ st is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illu@@ sion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this fing@@ er right here , my index fing@@ er is just going to shift from where it is , to a position
poin@@ ting out like this . nice one . someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my fing@@ er shif@@ ts .
and we could talk about why this is de@@ cep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fing@@ ers down here ,
because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my index fing@@ er being there .
and then when i close my fing@@ er , same thing ,
as i move back , this motion kind of cover@@ s the moving back of my fing@@ er .
i take this hand away . you give the kni@@ fe out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a research@@ er , so this , to me , was an aston@@ ishing thing .
it turns out that if you ad@@ minister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like a@@ spir@@ in shaped -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain measu@@ ra@@ ble effect .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a letter into it , it is actually measu@@ ra@@ bly more effective .
even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
a color@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
dos@@ age has something to do with this .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these dos@@ ages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ rin@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind ,
it &apos;s so much stronger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the need@@ le .
and none of it has any real ph@@ arm@@ aceu@@ tical quality ,
it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the need@@ le .
this is a seven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . it &apos;s very , very shar@@ p ,
and i &apos;m going to just steri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my fle@@ sh . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fle@@ sh .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
if you &apos;re que@@ as@@ y -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know ,
and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get que@@ as@@ y easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here ,
the beginning of my fle@@ sh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
i &apos;m sorry , man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the kni@@ fe trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fing@@ ers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ mb enough to sta@@ b himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes . so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know . and the people in the back go , &quot; ok , i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot; people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my fle@@ sh , and i can t@@ wist that around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting que@@ as@@ y , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding . well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the need@@ le out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no w@@ ounds .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate af@@ fair .
it was a beautiful fish : fla@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a be@@ st@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm@@ -@@ raised to the supposed highest stand@@ ards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us ch@@ efs :
how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
nin@@ et@@ y percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ m@@ ons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it :
fish far@@ ms pollu@@ te -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . take tun@@ a ,
a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif@@ t@@ een pounds of wild fish to get you one p@@ ound of farm tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p@@ .@@ r@@ . for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concentr@@ ated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said . &quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? what are you fe@@ eding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable prote@@ ins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ ins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company ;
no one could give me a straight answer
until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolo@@ gist .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable prote@@ ins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken pel@@ lets .
i said , &quot; chicken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , f@@ ea@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , sc@@ r@@ aps , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about fe@@ eding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pau@@ se on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , goo@@ dy@@ -@@ two shoes foo@@ die .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i swe@@ ar to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern sp@@ ain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shi@@ mm@@ ering , white color .
the ch@@ ef had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
like twice over .
ama@@ z@@ ingly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el --
actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t c@@ ook the fish , and he &apos;s not a ch@@ ef ,
at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolo@@ gist at ve@@ ta la pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of sp@@ ain .
it &apos;s at the tip of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the ar@@ gen@@ tin@@ i@@ ans .
they raised be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially wet@@ lands .
they did it by dra@@ ining the land .
they built this in@@ tric@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they pu@@ shed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
and ecolo@@ g@@ ically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds ,
which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a span@@ ish company with an environmental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
what did they do ?
they re@@ vers@@ ed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of pu@@ shing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to pull water back in .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- bas@@ s , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , eel -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ecolo@@ gical destruction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
okay ? there we are slo@@ gging through the wet@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare blac@@ k-@@ shoul@@ dered k@@ ite .
now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the miner@@ al needs of phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tan@@ zan@@ ian gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ ku@@ mi national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aqu@@ ati@@ c plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ plu@@ gged , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was s@@ woon@@ ing over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he pointed at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom@@ as@@ s , the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zoo@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ rene@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we r@@ ounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al pin@@ k car@@ p@@ et for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , pin@@ k .
they &apos;re f@@ ea@@ sting . &quot;
f@@ ea@@ sting ? i was totally confu@@ sed .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they f@@ ea@@ sting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sh@@ ook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we farm exten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
this is an ecolo@@ gical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s revie@@ w :
a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that measu@@ res its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
a fish farm , but also a bird san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they brood in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building ne@@ sts .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every even@@ ing , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 92 .
no kid@@ ding .
i was imag@@ ining a &quot; mar@@ ch of the pengu@@ ins &quot; thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just quo@@ ted a whit@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; no ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my belo@@ ved fish , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and i don &apos;t like fish skin ;
i don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , i don &apos;t like it cri@@ sp@@ y .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , tar@@ -@@ like fla@@ vor .
i almost never c@@ ook with it .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern sp@@ ain , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted s@@ weet and clean , like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
ok . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish ,
a farm that measu@@ res its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
and then i realized when he says , &quot; a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ statement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
it &apos;s a river that carri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , pe@@ st@@ ici@@ de ru@@ no@@ ff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean@@ er than when it enter@@ ed .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that measu@@ res its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation plant --
and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mp@@ s out into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also instruc@@ tive .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radic@@ ally new concep@@ tion of agriculture , one in which the food actually tast@@ es good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not reali@@ sts , us foo@@ dies ;
we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets ,
we love small family far@@ ms ,
we talk about local food ,
we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gr@@ os@@ s ine@@ qu@@ alities in distribution , not ton@@ na@@ ge .
now , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , pe@@ stic@@ id@@ es to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re fe@@ eding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motiv@@ ation ,
it &apos;s been the ju@@ sti@@ fic@@ ation :
it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is : a business in liqu@@ id@@ ation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding ecolo@@ gical capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is thre@@ aten@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supply , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources . not by the lat@@ est comb@@ ine and trac@@ tor invention , but by fer@@ ti@@ le land ; not by pu@@ mp@@ s , but by fresh water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and ne@@ ts , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better : how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the ecolo@@ gical model .
that &apos;s the one that rel@@ ies on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el , farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el . far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that re@@ store instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm exten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers , but experts in relationships . because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fla@@ vor , too .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better ch@@ ef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
thank you .
i grew up on a ste@@ ad@@ y diet of science fiction .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satis@@ fied , in a narrative form , this in@@ sati@@ able sense of curi@@ osity that i had .
and you know , that curi@@ osity also manife@@ sted itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the woo@@ ds , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sna@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the micros@@ cope .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans . jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ d@@ rou@@ s world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imag@@ ined .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this sat@@ u@@ ration of c@@ g movies and all of this ima@@ gery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw ali@@ en creatures , ali@@ en worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class dood@@ ling behind the tex@@ t@@ book .
that was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened : the jac@@ ques cou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hip some@@ day --
that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imag@@ ined from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a sc@@ u@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
i pe@@ ster@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ u@@ ba class in buff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and i actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a pool at a y@@ m@@ ca in the dead of winter in buff@@ al@@ o , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the interven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so bound@@ less compared to our own mea@@ ger human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and my love af@@ fair with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i chose a career as an adult , it was film@@ making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ conc@@ ile this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so , film@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of underwater and di@@ ving with film@@ making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liqu@@ id water cre@@ ature , we actually embr@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated anima@@ tion , c@@ g .
and this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface character , c@@ g anima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , i should say -- i wit@@ ne@@ ssed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was me@@ sm@@ eri@@ zed by this appar@@ ent magic .
you know , it &apos;s arthur c@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently advanced technology is indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ ha@@ ble from magic .
they were seeing something ma@@ gical .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embr@@ ac@@ ed into the c@@ ine@@ matic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with il@@ m , we created the liqu@@ id me@@ tal du@@ de in that film . the success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did , and we created magic again ,
and we had the same result with an audience --
although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; this is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with stan win@@ ston , my good friend stan win@@ ston , who is the pre@@ mier ma@@ ke@@ -up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analo@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves la@@ gging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually f@@ ounded the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with reali@@ stic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g , and the main characters would all be in c@@ g , and the world would be in c@@ g . and the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e pu@@ shed back ,
and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; ro@@ me@@ o and ju@@ liet &apos; on a ship :
&quot; it &apos;s going to be this ep@@ ic roman@@ ce , passionate film . &quot;
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; tit@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing h@@ ook . &quot;
and i talked them into funding an expedi@@ tion .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later , i find myself in a russi@@ an sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real tit@@ an@@ ic through a view port . not a movie , not h@@ d -- for real .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ st@@ ile environment where there is no hope of resc@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , i really got b@@ itten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation .
of course , the curi@@ osity , the science component of it --
it was everything . it was ad@@ venture , it was curi@@ osity , it was imagination . and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent expedi@@ tions , i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal ven@@ ts and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and ima@@ ged them .
so , i was completely sm@@ itten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; tit@@ an@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; ok , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l-@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these expedi@@ tions .
and we w@@ ound up going to the b@@ is@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehic@@ les .
we went back to the tit@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
we took little bo@@ ts that we had created that sp@@ oo@@ led a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior survey of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the de@@ ck of tit@@ an@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , &quot; i &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle . i felt like i was physically present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of tit@@ an@@ ic .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact replic@@ a on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ presence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is injec@@ ted into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
and it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these expedi@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean ven@@ ts where we had these amazing , amazing animals --
they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
they live in an environment of chem@@ osy@@ n@@ the@@ sis .
they don &apos;t survive on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 50@@ 0-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade water plu@@ mes .
you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and i w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russia , going through the pre-@@ cos@@ mon@@ au@@ t bi@@ ome@@ dic@@ al proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i w@@ ound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access -- astro@@ biolo@@ gists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the ven@@ ts , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instru@@ ments , and so on .
so , here we were making docu@@ mentary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i &apos;d completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot about leadership .
now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these expedi@@ tions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no f@@ ame in it .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; tit@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; av@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was buff@@ ing my na@@ ils some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these docu@@ mentary films for a very limited audience .
no f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is -- for the thr@@ ill of discovery , and for that strange b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly kn@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time ,
sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the atten@@ tu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspec@@ ts of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in comb@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a b@@ ond , creates a b@@ ond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted terr@@ it@@ ory , doing &quot; av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challen@@ ging .
and we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , people have com@@ mented on how , &quot; well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of p@@ and@@ ora . &quot;
to me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we synthe@@ size out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curi@@ osity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manife@@ st a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the la@@ ur@@ els in the world .
i have young film@@ makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some advice for doing this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put lim@@ it@@ ations on yourself .
other people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself ,
and take risks . &quot;
nasa has this phra@@ se that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in explor@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
and no important en@@ de@@ av@@ or that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts ,
and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , acci@@ dents .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emer@@ ges .
this is because , in the mid-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death ,
seeing that cir@@ cul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that acci@@ dents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dr@@ ill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swi@@ mming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphic .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustr@@ ated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dr@@ ill into a decade .
you can dr@@ ill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ le@@ tes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
i &apos;m a lance arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which lance arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ c@@ ling ? &quot;
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
and i see gre@@ g le@@ mond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navi@@ gate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not search@@ ing , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extr@@ apol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and we reduc@@ ed it down to a little sum@@ mary .
so the sum@@ mary consi@@ sts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sel@@ ect government .
now , having selec@@ ted government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently cor@@ respond to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insight that was not con@@ ta@@ ined within any one wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dr@@ ill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government ;
some have come from natural sci@@ ences ;
some , fewer still , have come from business --
there &apos;s my bos@@ s --
and one has come from music .
and interest@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win@@ ners .
so you see , we &apos;re navi@@ g@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from pa@@ ge-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstr@@ action .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this applic@@ ation -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zoo@@ ma@@ ble technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
so i can dr@@ ill into what i &apos;ve done over specific time fra@@ mes .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history --
here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic search@@ ing , looking for bing , over here for live la@@ bs pi@@ vo@@ t .
and from these , i can dr@@ ill into the web page and just la@@ unch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the ha@@ bit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in sp@@ ite of all this fl@@ ood of work , there are several cognitive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tr@@ aps .
this app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to schol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as me@@ ssed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ u@@ ct@@ ance to ad@@ mit complexity .
it turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second tra@@ p is a confu@@ sion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the foc@@ using illu@@ sion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ stance that affec@@ ts well-@@ being without di@@ stor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a questi@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer se@@ ssion after one of my lectures repor@@ ted a story ,
and that was a story --
he said he &apos;d been listening to a symp@@ hon@@ y , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tionally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the memor@@ ies of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experi@@ encing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experi@@ encing self that the doctor approach@@ es -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a reme@@ mber@@ ing self , and the reme@@ mber@@ ing self is the one that keep@@ s score , and main@@ tains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor approach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling lat@@ ely ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ encing self and the reme@@ mber@@ ing self , and getting confu@@ sed between them is part of the me@@ ss about the notion of happiness .
now , the reme@@ mber@@ ing self is a story@@ tel@@ ler .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memor@@ ies -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ dure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
here are two patients ,
those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more --
his colon@@ os@@ copy was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had , patient b had , and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise . the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ os@@ copy than patient b .
the stories of the colon@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends . and nei@@ ther of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distin@@ ct ... but one of them is distin@@ c@@ tly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ;
it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ? because we asked these people after their colon@@ os@@ copy , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b , in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ encing self and the reme@@ mber@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the colon@@ os@@ copy of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ g@@ ling it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ encing self of patient a worse off , and you have the reme@@ mber@@ ing self of patient a a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
now , the experi@@ encing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward :
they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long ;
that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ;
in a month , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 --
most of them don &apos;t leave a tr@@ ace .
most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the reme@@ mber@@ ing self .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the reme@@ mber@@ ing self keep@@ s for us .
so we have the reme@@ mber@@ ing self and the experi@@ encing self , and they &apos;re really quite distin@@ ct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the reme@@ mber@@ ing self .
for the reme@@ mber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new memor@@ ies added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es a reme@@ mber@@ ing self from an experi@@ encing self ;
time has very little impact on the story .
now , the reme@@ mber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ geon that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
the experi@@ encing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences ,
we choose between memor@@ ies of experiences . and even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as anti@@ cip@@ ated memor@@ ies .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self , and you can think of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ gging the experi@@ encing self through experiences that the experi@@ encing self doesn &apos;t need . i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our reme@@ mber@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to ju@@ sti@@ fy i think .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our memor@@ ies ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , rel@@ ative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have consu@@ med my memor@@ ies of that three-@@ week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te i have for consu@@ ming memor@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : why do we put so much weight on memory rel@@ ative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ ne@@ sic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ? and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves ,
and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict ,
and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer ,
and if you think in terms of memor@@ ies , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concep@@ ts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ encing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ encing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ encing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how satis@@ fied or ple@@ ased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t di@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to me@@ ss up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a cro@@ wd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been me@@ ssing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ encing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now effor@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately . the gal@@ lu@@ p organization has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences ,
and there have been other effor@@ ts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice vers@@ a .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
you have that much un@@ certain@@ ty . if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ encing self .
so the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
we know something about what contro@@ ls satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other plea@@ su@@ res , but this is domin@@ ant .
so if you want to ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not atten@@ d to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ encing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the reflec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
but now , because the reflec@@ tive self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to tr@@ ace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experi@@ encing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen : they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how horri@@ ble the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o ,
and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gal@@ lu@@ p survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
dan@@ iel ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man : sure . i think the most interesting result that we found in the gal@@ lu@@ p survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ encing self .
when we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a large represen@@ t@@ ative sample -- below an income of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year ...
ca : 6@@ 0,000 . d@@ k : 6@@ 0,000 . 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progre@@ ssi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i &apos;ve rar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the reme@@ mber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
ca : but dan@@ ny , the whole american en@@ de@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
d@@ k : you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u.k. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evalu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
how to en@@ han@@ ce happiness goes very different ways depen@@ ding on how you think , and whether you think of the reme@@ mber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ encing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , effor@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
ca : well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inven@@ ting behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you , dan@@ ny ka@@ h@@ ne@@ man .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vacc@@ ines and se@@ eds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow :
there will be too much rain , not enough rain ,
things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to star@@ v@@ ation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really advanced civilization is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ el@@ ed the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very stra@@ igh@@ t@@ forward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects :
the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ t effects , in that the natural ecosyste@@ ms can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times :
do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying &quot; we &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve-@@ foo@@ t-@@ high truck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of s@@ que@@ e@@ ze under . &quot;
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons ;
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even f@@ lat@@ ten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly ri@@ sing to f@@ alling , and f@@ alling all the way to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four factors ,
a little bit of multi@@ p@@ lic@@ ation :
so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ geb@@ ra , but let &apos;s take a look .
first , we &apos;ve got population .
the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ compas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deliver@@ ed per person .
here we have a very basic service :
do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your home@@ work ? and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service ,
here finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inven@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings --
there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite sub@@ stan@@ tially .
some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make fer@@ tili@@ zer , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimi@@ stic , we may get a reduc@@ tion of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is : can you actually get that to zero ?
if you bur@@ n coal , no .
if you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging renewa@@ b@@ les and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mi@@ rac@@ les .
now , when i use the term &quot; mi@@ rac@@ le , &quot; i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a mi@@ rac@@ le . the personal computer is a mi@@ rac@@ le .
the internet and its services are a mi@@ rac@@ le .
so , the people here have particip@@ ated in the creation of many mi@@ rac@@ les .
usually , we don &apos;t have a dead@@ line , where you have to get the mi@@ rac@@ le by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mi@@ rac@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght ti@@ mel@@ ine .
now , i thought , &quot; how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illu@@ stra@@ tion , some demonstra@@ tion that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mos@@ quit@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ quit@@ os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that releas@@ ing fi@@ ref@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ mm@@ ic@@ ky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ belie@@ vable scale and un@@ belie@@ vable reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , geo@@ ther@@ mal , fu@@ sion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning fossil fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning coal or bur@@ ning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not ,
and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liqu@@ id , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
now we have some pil@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tri@@ cky , and agre@@ e@@ ing on where these co2 qu@@ anti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ g@@ hest one here is this long-term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems :
cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ;
the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
people need to feel good about it .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ vable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often ref@@ er to as the renewa@@ ble sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some disa@@ d@@ van@@ ta@@ ges .
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is drama@@ tically less than a power plant .
this is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
and so , if you dep@@ end on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time perio@@ ds that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here ,
we have trans@@ mission challenges :
for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
and , to dimension@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for fla@@ sh@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of 100 better than the approach@@ es we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mi@@ rac@@ le battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; they &apos;re crazy . &quot; that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gr@@ os@@ s has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
vin@@ o@@ d k@@ h@@ os@@ la &apos;s inve@@ sting in do@@ zens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
na@@ than my@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpri@@ sing@@ ly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innov@@ ations in nuclear : modu@@ lar , liqu@@ id .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of terr@@ ap@@ o@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ an@@ ium -- the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; let &apos;s bur@@ n the 99 percent , the u@@ 23@@ 8 . &quot;
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not ,
and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes ,
with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ file .
you actually bur@@ n up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s reac@@ tors .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ thes this ur@@ an@@ ium as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a cand@@ le .
you can see it &apos;s a log there , often refer@@ red to as a traveling wave reac@@ tor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in ken@@ tu@@ cky .
this is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now ,
so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ tering se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think : how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
for 2050 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduc@@ tion .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture ,
hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up fore@@ stry , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
so , the other grade is : are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key element of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency measu@@ res to start getting reduc@@ tions :
the less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big reduc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pil@@ ot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a frame@@ work that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented -- this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research funding .
when countries get together in places like c@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , they shouldn &apos;t just disc@@ u@@ ss the co2 .
they should disc@@ u@@ ss this innovation agenda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innov@@ ative approach@@ es .
we do need the market in@@ centi@@ ves -- co2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this di@@ alo@@ gue be a more rational , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ alo@@ gue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
chris anderson : thank you . thank you .
thank you . so to understand more about terr@@ ap@@ o@@ wer , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
bi@@ l gates : to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an reac@@ tor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pil@@ ot reac@@ tor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as adver@@ tis@@ ed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
ca : and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ an@@ ium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
bg : that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always refu@@ eling the reac@@ tor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out ,
that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a log -- put it down and not have those same complex@@ i@@ ties .
and it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
ca : it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disp@@ os@@ al solution .
bg : yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these coo@@ ling p@@ ools or dry c@@ asking by reac@@ tors --
that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those reac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re reduc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite drama@@ tically as you &apos;re going through this process .
ca : i mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here . where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
bg : well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting disc@@ los@@ ure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russia , india , china --
i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy agenda .
so i &apos;m optimi@@ stic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important advan@@ ce , but it &apos;s like a fast reac@@ tor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast reac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
ca : so , in your mind , ti@@ me@@ scale and likel@@ i@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
bg : well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , electro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the dead@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , terr@@ ap@@ o@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ zens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pil@@ ot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
ca : in terms of bi@@ g-@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
bg : an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environmental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innov@@ ators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modu@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liqu@@ id@@ -@@ type reac@@ tor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ an@@ ium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
ca : if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emergen@@ cy measu@@ res to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
bg : if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack :
then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called geo@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an insur@@ ance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the geo@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot slo@@ wer than we expect ?
ca : climate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
bg : well , unfortunately , the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing --
in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , &quot; ok , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics say , &quot; ok , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
ca : and so , that would be your response to the b@@ jor@@ n l@@ om@@ bor@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth ,
it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can disa@@ gre@@ e , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that --
that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap ,
i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our life@@ style .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even l@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
his sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and so there is a thre@@ ad of something that i think is appropriate .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
ca : well bill , i susp@@ ect i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
bg : thank you .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
i always keep my the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us hand@@ y whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished edi@@ ting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
let me read you the en@@ try .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ jec@@ tive : cri@@ p@@ ple@@ d , hel@@ ple@@ ss , u@@ sel@@ ess , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ alled , ma@@ im@@ ed , w@@ ounded , man@@ g@@ led , l@@ ame , mu@@ ti@@ lat@@ ed , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n-@@ out , wea@@ ken@@ ed , im@@ po@@ tent , ca@@ str@@ ated , par@@ aly@@ zed , han@@ dic@@ apped , sen@@ ile , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ id@@ -up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in crac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ ted-@@ out ; see also hurt , u@@ sel@@ ess and we@@ ak .
an@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ rou@@ s , but i &apos;d just gotten past &quot; man@@ g@@ led , &quot; and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the as@@ sa@@ ult from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
you know , of course , this is my ra@@ gge@@ dy old the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us
so i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
but , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us back then .
i mean , from this en@@ try , it would seem that i was born into a world that percei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ soe@@ ver going for them , when in fact , today i &apos;m celebr@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ ven@@ tures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online edi@@ tion , expe@@ cting to find a re@@ vision worth no@@ ting .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this en@@ try .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; near an@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; who@@ le@@ some . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those values .
our language affec@@ ts our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ eks and the roman@@ s , believed that to u@@ tter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
by ca@@ su@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sha@@ dows on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open doors for them instead ?
one such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor at the a.@@ i@@ . du@@ pon@@ t institute in wil@@ m@@ ington , dela@@ ware .
his name was dr. pi@@ z@@ zu@@ til@@ lo ,
an itali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to p@@ ron@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
and dr. p always wor@@ e really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect disp@@ osi@@ tion to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the excep@@ tion of my physical therapy se@@ ssi@@ ons .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able repe@@ ti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ a@@ stic b@@ ands -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg musc@@ les ,
and i h@@ ated these b@@ ands more than anything --
i h@@ ated them , had names for them . i h@@ ated them .
and , you know , i was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my se@@ ssion -- ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these se@@ ssi@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ mee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the pros@@ pe@@ ct of being the rich@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was re@@ shape an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
and i have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shaped my own view of myself as an inher@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ n@@ ite the power of a child .
but , in the previous in@@ stances of those the@@ sa@@ ur@@ us en@@ tries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , la@@ ser surgery for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ an@@ ium k@@ ne@@ es and hip replac@@ e@@ ments for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go ali@@ g@@ n with global groups of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to ad@@ apt is our greatest as@@ set .
the human ability to ad@@ apt , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission :
this phra@@ se never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
implic@@ it in this phra@@ se of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ de@@ step or circum@@ navi@@ gate the pre@@ su@@ med pit@@ falls of a life with pros@@ the@@ tics , or what other people percei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emo@@ tionally or both .
and i &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ad@@ vers@@ ity isn &apos;t an ob@@ stac@@ le that we need to get around in order to re@@ su@@ me living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my sha@@ dow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there is ad@@ vers@@ ity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a di@@ ss@@ erv@@ ice to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ad@@ apt .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the objec@@ tive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the subjec@@ tive socie@@ tal opini@@ on of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consi@@ stent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to confron@@ t is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defini@@ tions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is , or , indeed , a pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their poten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a partner@@ ship between those percei@@ ved de@@ fic@@ i@@ en@@ cies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about de@@ valu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wr@@ apped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embr@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ re@@ st@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natural , consi@@ stent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
this year we celebr@@ ate the 200@@ th birth@@ day of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustr@@ ated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to par@@ aph@@ ra@@ se : it &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tested , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
ad@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal ,
and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ ige person if they exist@@ ed ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achie@@ ving nor@@ mal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or poten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and inv@@ ite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthrop@@ ologists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ jury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community . they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and u@@ sel@@ ess ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ aster@@ n penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , and i was standing over a bu@@ she@@ l of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
it was su@@ mm@@ er@@ time : i had shor@@ ts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deliver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr. ke@@ an , a man that i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birth@@ day by two weeks .
and so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physici@@ an had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deliver@@ ed me was a complete stran@@ ger to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this stran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of indepen@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether winning a second grade spel@@ ling bee , mar@@ ching with the girl sc@@ ou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ w@@ een para@@ de , winning my college schol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sports vic@@ t@@ ories , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching resi@@ dent students , med students from ha@@ h@@ ne@@ mann medical school and her@@ she@@ y medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and dr. ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cu@@ m of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , dr. ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tra@@ ded pros@@ the@@ tics for fle@@ sh@@ -@@ and-@@ bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have he@@ sit@@ ated for a second .
i a@@ spi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ cy back then .
but if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sha@@ dows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the ep@@ i@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so recep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a cruci@@ al moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open doors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the r@@ oot word &quot; e@@ duce . &quot;
it means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 196@@ 0s britain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it &quot; tracking &quot; here in the states .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the &quot; a students &quot; get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , d-@@ level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were &quot; a &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright ,
and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were performing at a-@@ level .
and , of course , the he@@ art@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; a students &quot; and told them they were &quot; d &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
those who were still around in school , be@@ sides the people who had dro@@ pped out .
a cruci@@ al part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , &quot; these are the &apos; a-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; d-@@ students . &apos; &quot;
and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cru@@ shed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cru@@ shed doesn &apos;t have hope ,
it doesn &apos;t see beauty ,
it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curi@@ osity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those qu@@ alities , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ teen@@ th-@@ century per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jac@@ ques dem@@ bo@@ is told me about ,
and the poem is called &quot; the god who only knows four words &quot; :
&quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and keep@@ s repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; come dance with me . come , dance with me . come , dance with me . &apos; &quot;
thank you .
